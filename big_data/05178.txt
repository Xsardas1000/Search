Unramiﬁed Euler sums and Hoﬀman (cid:63) basis

Claire Glanois

March 17, 2016

Abstract

When looking at how periods of πm

1 (P1(cid:31){0, 1,∞}), i.e. multiple zeta values, embeds into
1 (P1(cid:31){0,±1,∞}), i.e. Euler sums, an explicit criteria via the coaction ∆ acting
periods of πm
on their motivic versionsI comes out. In this paper, adopting this Galois descent approach,
we present a new basis for the space H1 of motivic multiple zeta values via motivic Euler
sums. Up to an analytic conjectureII, we also prove that the motivic Hoﬀman star basis
ζ (cid:63),m(2a1 , 3,··· , 3, 2ap , 3, 2b) is a basis of H1. Under a general motivic identity that we conjec-
tureIII, these bases are identical. Other examples of unramiﬁed ES with alternating patterns
of even and odds are also provided.

Introduction

The weight, often denoted w below, is deﬁned as w :=(cid:80) | ni |, the depth is the length p,

whereas the height, denoted h, is the number of | ni | greater than 1. The weight is conjec-
turally a grading, whereas the depth is only a ﬁltration. The special case for which all ni are
positive corresponds to the well-known multiple zeta values, denoted MZV. Let’s introduce
also Z 2, resp. Z 1 the Q-vector space spanned by these Euler sums, resp. multiple zeta values.
These Euler sums are particularly interesting examples of periods in the sense of Kontsevich-
Zagier IV, and are ﬂourishing in the literature, for their savory multiple connections with mixed
Tate motives, quantum ﬁeld theory (with Feynman amplitudes), modular forms, etc. From

the zoo of relations satisﬁed by these Euler sums, let remember the regularized double shuf-
ﬂe I, which turns Z 1,Z 2 into algebras, and the so-called octagon relationII, which is used below.

They are motivic periods of the category of Mixed Tate Motives MT (cid:0)Z(cid:2) 1

This article mainly focuses on the motivic versions of those numbers: i.e. motivic Euler
sums, resp. motivic multiple zeta values, denoted ζm(·) and shortened MES, resp. MMZV.
generated by the motivic fundamental group of P1(cid:31){0,±1,∞}, resp. P1(cid:31){0, 1,∞}. They
span the Q-vector spaces H2, resp. H1. Moreover, H2 is an Hopf algebra, whose coaction is
explicitly given by a combinatorial formula (2.3.2). This coaction is the dual of an action of a
so-called motivic Galois group G on these speciﬁc motivic periods.
Furthermore, there is a surjective homomorphism, called the period map, which is conjectured
to be an isomorphism (special case of Grothendieck’s period conjecture):

(cid:3)(cid:1), resp. MT (Z),

2

per : w : HN → Z N ,

ζ m(·) (cid:55)→ ζ(·).

(2)

Working on the motivic side, besides being conjecturally identical to the complex numbers
side, turns out to be somehow simpler, since the motivic theory provides this Hopf Algebra
structure. Notably, each identity between MES implies an identity for ES, by application of
this period map; for instance, a motivic basis for MMZV, as the one obtained in section 4 is
hence a generating family (conjecturally basis) for MZV.

Before delving into the main results of this paper, let introduce the following variants of
ES (Deﬁnition 3.1):
Euler (cid:63) sums are the analogue multiple sums than ES (1) with large inequalities and veri-

ﬁes:III

ζ (cid:63)(n1, . . . , np) =

ζ(n1 ◦ ··· ◦ np).

◦=‘+’ or ,

Euler (cid:93) sums are similarly linear combinations of MZV, with 2-power coeﬃcients:

ζ (cid:93)(n1, . . . , np) =

2p−n+ ζ(n1 ◦ ··· ◦ np),

with n+ the number of + .

(4)

(cid:88)

◦=‘+’ or ,

Notations:

· This ‘ + ’ operation in Z, is a summation of absolute values, while signs are multiplied.
· A negative n in a (motivic) Euler sum is also denoted below by an overline m, where
m := −n positive. For instance ζ•(3, 1, 5) = ζ•(−3, 1,−5).

Main Results:

(i)

Theorem. Motivic Euler (cid:93) sums with only positive odd and negative even integers as
arguments are unramiﬁed: i.e. Q linear combinations of motivic multiple zeta values.
By [8], it means that they are Frobenius invariant geometric motivic periods of MT (Z).
This family is even a generating family of MMZV from which we extract a basis:
Theorem. A graded basis of H1, the space of motivic multiple zeta values is:

{ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0)2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2(cid:1) , ai ≥ 0}.

The proof is based on the good behaviour of this family with respect to the coaction and
the depth ﬁltration; the suitable ﬁltration corresponding to the motivic depth for this
family is the usual depth minus 1. By application of the period map, this leads to:
Corollary. Each multiple zeta value of depth < d is a Q linear combination of elements

ζ (cid:93)(cid:0)2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2(cid:1), of the same weight with ai ≥ 0, p ≤ d.

(ii)

IFor a good introduction to MZV, cf. [13], [39]. Conjecturally, it generates all relations between MZV.
IIThe hexagon relation for MZV (cf. [20]) is turned into an octagon relation (cf. 1) for ES.
IIIThese have already been studied in many papers: [5], [25], [27], [32], [35], [43].

Theorem. I If the analytic conjecture (5.4) holds, then the motivic Hoﬀman (cid:63) family
{ζ (cid:63),m({2, 3}×)} is a basis of H1, the space of MMZV.
Denote by H2,3 the Q-vector space spanned by the motivic Hoﬀman (cid:63) family. The idea
of the proof is similar as in the non-star case done by Francis Brown. We deﬁne an
increasing ﬁltration F L• on H2,3, called the level, such that:II

F L
l H2,3 is spanned by ζ (cid:63),m(2a0 , 3,··· , 3, 2al ), with less than “l” 3.

One key feature is that the vector space F L
l H2,3 is stable under the action of G. The
linear independence is then proved thanks to a recursion on the level and on the weight,
using the injectivity of a map ∂ where ∂ came out of the level and weight-graded part
of the coaction ∆ (cf. §5.1). The injectivity is proved via 2-adic properties of some
coeﬃcients with Conjecture 5.4. One noteworthy diﬀerence is that, when computing
the coaction on the motivic MZV(cid:63), some motivic MZV(cid:63)(cid:63) arise, which are a non con-
vergent analogues of MZV(cid:63) and have to be renormalized. Therefore, where Brown in
the non-star case needed an analytic formula proven by Don Zagier ([40]), we need some
slightly more complicated identities (in Lemma 5.3) because the elements involved, such
as ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),m(2a, 3, 2b) for instance, are not of depth 1 but are linear combinations of products
of depth 1 motivic MZV times a power of π, as proved in Lemma 5.3.

(iii) We also pave the way for a motivic version of a generalization of a Linebarger and Zhao’s

equality which expresses each motivic MZV(cid:63) as a motivic Euler (cid:93) sums:
Conjecture. For ai, ci ∈ N∗, ci (cid:54)= 2,

ζ (cid:63),m (2a0 , c1,··· , cp, 2ap ) = (−1)1+δc1 ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0)B0, 1c1−3,··· , 1ci−3, Bi, . . . , Bp
 B0 := (−1)2a0−δc1 (2a0 + 1 − δc1 )

Bi := (−1)2ai−δci
Bp := (−1)2ap+1−δcp (2ap + 2 − δcp )

whereIII

−δci+1 (2ai + 3 − δci − δci+1 )

(cid:1) ,

.

It extends the Two One formula [Ohno-Zudilin], the Three One Formula [Zagier], and
Linebarger Zhao formula, and in particular, thanks to (i), it implies (ii), i.e. that the
Hoﬀman(cid:63) family is a basis.
Nota Bene: Such a motivic relation between MES is stronger than its analogue between
ES since it contains more information; it implies many other relations because of its
Galois conjugates. This explain why its is not always simple to lift an identity from ES
to MES from the Theorem 2.2. If the family concerned is not stable via the coaction,
such as (iv) in Lemma 5.3, we may need other analytic equalities before concluding.

Remarks
• The ﬁrst (very naive) idea, when looking for a basis for the space of MZV, is to choose:

{ζ (2n1 + 1, 2n2 + 1, . . . , 2np + 1) (2iπ)2s, ni ∈ N

∗

, s ∈ N}.

However, considering Broadhurst-Kreimer conjecture, the depth ﬁltration clearly does
not behave so nicely in the case of MZV IV. Consequently, in order to ﬁnd a basis of
motivic MZV, we have to:

Either: Pass by motivic Euler sums, as the Euler (cid:93) basis ((i) above).

Or: Allow higher depths, as Hoﬀman basis ([8]), or Hoﬀman (cid:63) basis ((ii) above).

• Looking at how periods of MT (Z) embed into periods of MT (Z[ 1

2 ]), i.e. when a motivic
in H1) is a fragment of the Galois descent ideas, as we

unramiﬁed, stated in §2.3.4 via the coaction.

• Such results on linear independence of a family of motivic MZV are proved recursively,
once we have found the appropriate level ﬁltration on the elements; ideally, the family
considered is stable under the derivations I; the ﬁltration, as we will see below, should
correspond to the motivic depth deﬁned in §2.3.3, and decrease under the derivations II;
if the derivations, modulo some spaces, act as a deconcatenation on these elements, linear
independence follows naturally from this recursion. Nevertheless, to start this procedure,
we need an analytic identity, which is left as a conjecture here. This conjecture is of an
entirely diﬀerent nature from the techniques developed here. We expect that it could be
proved using analytic methods along the lines of [40], [31].

• Finding a good basis for the space of motivic multiple zeta values is a fundamental
question. Hoﬀman basis may be unsatisfactory for various reasons, while this basis with
Euler sums (linear combinations with 2 power coeﬃcients) may appear slightly more
natural, in particular since the motivic depth is here the depth minus 1. However,
both of these two bases are not bases of the Z module and the primes appearing in the
determinant of the passage matrix are growing rather fast.III

(cid:17)

.

• For these two theorems, in order to simplify the coaction, we crucially need a motivic
identity in the coalgebra L, proved in §3.3, coming from the octagon relation pictured in
Figure 1. More precisely, we need to consider the linearized version of the anti-invariant
part by the Frobenius at inﬁnity of this relation, in order to prove the following relation
(Theorem 3.4), for ni ∈ Z∗:

k (n0,··· , np)+ζ l|n0|+k (n1, . . . , np) ≡ (−1)w+1(cid:16)

ζ l
k+|np| (np−1, . . . , n0)
Thanks to this hybrid relation, and the antipodal relations presented in §3.2, the coaction
expression is considerably simpliﬁed in Appendix A.

ζ l
k (np, . . . , n0) + ζ l

Contents: After a quick overview on the motivic background in order to introduce the Hopf
algebra of motivic Euler sums, we present the (cid:63) and (cid:93) versions, with some useful motivic
relations (antipodal and hybrid). The fourth section focuses on some speciﬁc Euler (cid:93) sums,
starting by a broad subfamily of unramiﬁed elements and extracting from it a new basis for
H1, whereas the ﬁfth section deals with the Hoﬀman star family, proving it is a basis of H1, up
to an analytic conjecture (5.4). The last section presents a conjectured motivic equality (6.1)
which turns each motivic MZV (cid:63) into a motivic Euler (cid:93) sums of the previous honorary family;
in particular, under this conjecture, the two previous bases are identical. Appendix A. gathers
the coaction calculus used both in section 4 and 5, via relations proved in section 3. Appendix
B simply lists the homographies of P1(cid:31){0, µN , ∞}, for N = 1, 2. Some identities coming
from the linearized octagon relation, not used in this paper, are presented in appendix C.
Appendix D provides some examples of unramiﬁed ES up to depth 5, with alternated patterns
of even and odd, while Appendix E gives the proof of Theorem 6.2 and Appendix F highlights
some missing coeﬃcients in Lemma 5.3, although not needed for the proof of the Hoﬀman (cid:63)
Theorem 5.1.

Aknowledgements: The author deeply thanks Francis Brown for a few discussions and fun-
damental suggestionsIV on this work, and Jianqiang Zhao for his careful reading of this article

some part of it, to look the distance of these basis to a Z module basis, and to Herbert Gangl
for pointing out the Yamamoto interpolation[38]. This work was partly supported by ERC
Grant 257638, and also is very grateful to the stay in the Dirk Kreimer team (Humboldt
University, Berlin), where it really grew up.

2 Motivic Background

This section sketches the motivic context in which this works mostly takes place: the category
of Mixed Tate Motives, the motivic iterated integrals, the motivic Galois group, the motivic
fundamental groupoid. For more details and enlightened surveys on some of these motivic
aspects, we refer to [1] and [26] for motivesI; [18] for tannakian categories; [2] for motivic
Galois theory; [3], [16], [10], [11], [17] for motivic periods and motivic iterated integrals; [23],
[17] for motivic fundamental groupoid; [22], [8] for the motivic Hopf algebra; and the recent
report [12] which gives a luxuriant overview of the motivic scene around the MZV. Notice that
this paper is essentially an extract of the author PhD [21], whose Chapter 2 provides more
details on this (motivic) scenery too.
Let point out a few highlights for this section:

· The combinatorial expression of the coaction (2.3.2), dual of the motivic Galois action is
the cornerstone of this work.
· Theorem 2.2 which states which elements are in the kernel of these derivations, sometimes
allows to lift identities from MZV to motivic MZV, up to rational coeﬃcients.
Nota Bene: A motivic relation is stronger and it may require several relations between
MZV in order to lift an identity to motivic MZV. An example of such a behaviour occurs
with some Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements, in Lemma 5.3.
· The Galois descent between MES and MMZV alluded in §2.3.4

2.1 Motivic scenery
Mixed Tate Motives For k a number ﬁeld (soon Q), we have at our disposal:

MT (k), the tannakian category of Mixed Tate motives over k with rational coeﬃcients

equipped with a weight ﬁltration Wr indexed by even integers such that:

· Every object M ∈ MT (k)Q is an iterated extension of Tate motivesII Q(n), n ∈ Z.
i.e.,

grW−2r(M ) is a sum of copies of Q(r) for M ∈ MT (k).

(cid:26) Ext1MT (k)(Q(0), Q(n)) ∼= K2n−1(k)Q ⊗ Q
ExtiMT (k)(Q(0), Q(n)) ∼= 0

if i > 1 or n ≤ 0.

·

In particular, the weight deﬁnes a canonical ﬁber functor ω:

ω : MT (k) → VecQ
M (cid:55)→ ⊕ωr(M )

with

(cid:26) ωr(M ) := HomMT (k)(Q(r), grW−2r(M ))

grW−2r(M ) = Q(r) ⊗ ωr(M ).

i.e.

Moreover, this category is equivalent to the category of representations of the so-called motivic
Galois group GM:III

M := MT (k)Q

From now, let’s restrict to k = Q. Betti, resp. de Rham cohomology lead to the realization

IIThe Lefschetz motive L := Q(−1) = H 1(Gm) = H 1(P1(cid:31){0, ∞}) is a pure motive with period (2iπ). Its dual is
the so-called Tate motive T := Q(1) = L∨. More generally, Tate motives Q(−n) := Q(−1)⊗n resp. Q(n) := Q(1)⊗n

Between all these realizations, we have comparison isomorphisms, such as compdR,B : MB ⊗Q
C −→∼ MdR ⊗Q,B C or its inverse compB,dR. Below, we will be looking at tensor-preserving
isomorphisms such as: GB := Aut⊗(ωB) and the (GB,GM) bitorsor PB,ω := Isom⊗(ω, ωB).

Remarks:

· A Mixed Tate motive over a Q is hence uniquely deﬁned by its de Rham realization, a
vector space MdR, with an action of its motivic Galois group.
· The tannakian category of Mixed Tate Motives over the ring of S-integers OS of any
number ﬁeld k (deﬁned in [17]) has the same extensions groups than MT (k), apart from
Ext1· (Q(0), Q(1)). More precisely, for the categories of Mixed Tate motives MT (Z) and

Motivic periods The algebra of motivic periods of a tannakian category of mixed Tate
motives M, is deﬁned as (cf. [16], [11], [10]):
P mM := O(Isom⊗

M(ω, ωB)) = O(PB,ω).

A motivic period denoted as a triplet [M, v, σ]m, element of P mM, is constructed from a
motive M ∈ Ind (M), and classes v ∈ ω(M ), σ ∈ ωB(M )∨. It is a function PB,ω → A1,
which, on its rational points, is given by:

PB,ω(Q) → Q ,

α (cid:55)→ (cid:104)α(v), σ(cid:105).

Its period is obtained by the evaluation on the complex point compB,dR:

[M, v, σ]m (cid:55)→ (cid:104)compB,dR(v ⊗ 1), σ(cid:105).

Remarks:

· This construction can be generalized for any pair of ﬁber functors. For instance, the

de Rham periods are P dRM := O(cid:0)Aut⊗(ωdR)(cid:1) = O(cid:0)GM(cid:1). Unipotent variants of these
P aM := O(cid:16)UM(cid:17)

with at our disposal a restriction map P ωM → P aM.

periods form the fundamental Hopf algebra deﬁned above:

= AM

,

· Any structure carried by these ﬁber functors (weight grading on ωdR, complex conjuga-
tion on ωB, etc.) is transmitted to the corresponding ring of periods. In particular, P mM
inherits a weight grading and we can deﬁne:

P m,+M ⊂ P mM, the ring of geometric periods, is generated by periods of motives with

non-negative weights: {[M, v, σ]m ∈ P mM | W−1M = 0}.

There is a morphism (details in [10], §2.6):

(9)
· The groupoid structure (composition) on the isomorphisms of ﬁber functors on M, by
dualizing, leads to a coalgebroid structure on the spaces of motivic periods:

πa,m : P m,+M → P aM.

∆m,ω : P mM → P dRM ⊗ P mM.

· Bear in mind also the non-canonical isomorphisms, compatible with weight and coaction
between these Q algebras:

P mM ∼= P aM ⊗Q Q(cid:2)(Lm)

−1, Lm(cid:3) ,

and P m,+M ∼= P aM ⊗Q Q [Lm] .

(10)

6

· The complex conjugation deﬁnes the real Frobenius F∞ : MB → MB, and induces an
involution on motivic periods F∞ : P mM → P mM, such that Lm is anti invariant. From
now, we will mostly restrict to the following motivic periods:

P m,+M,R the subset of P m,+M invariant under F∞, which satisﬁes:
P m,+M ∼= P m,+M,R ⊕ P m,+M,R.Lm and P m,+M,R

∼= P aM ⊗Q Q(cid:2)(Lm)2(cid:3) .

(11)

· The ring of motivic periods P mM is a bitorsor under Tannaka groups (GM,GB).
If
Grothendieck conjecture holds, via the period isomorphism, there is therefore a (left)
action of the motivic Galois group GM on periods. More precisely, for each period p
there would exist well deﬁned conjugates and an algebraic group over Q, the Galois
group of p, which transitively permutes the conjugates.
It would extend the classical
Galois theory for algebraic numbers to periods; cf. [2].

Motivic fundamental groupoid Let X := P1(cid:31){0,±1,∞}.I The fundamental group
π1(X, x) is freely generated by γ0, γ±1: loops around 0, ±1. Its completed Hopf algebra is:

(cid:99)π1 := lim←− Q[π1(X, x)](cid:30)I n, with I := (cid:104)γ − 1, γ ∈ Π(cid:105) the augmentation ideal,

equipped with the completed coproduct ∆ such that the elements of π1(X, x) are primitive.
It is isomorphic to the Hopf algebra of non commutative formal series:

i.e. the set of non-commutative formal series with N + 1 generators which are group-like for

2.3.2 Coaction
The motivic Galois group G and hence U acts on the de Rham realization 0Π1 (cf. [17],§4.12)
and (non trivially) it factorizes through the Ihara action ◦: 0Π1 ×0 Π1 →0 Π1. By duality,
this action gives rise to a coaction ∆MT . The combinatorial coaction ∆c (on words on 0,±1)
factorizes through ∆MT which factorizes through A, since U is the quotient of U by the kernel
of its action on 0Π1. By passing to the quotient, it induces a coaction ∆ on H:

Kernel of D<n. Let ﬁrst highlight that since L2r = 0, we can consider only {D2r+1}r≥0.
A key point for the use of these derivations is the ability to prove some relations (and possibly
lift some from MZV to motivic MZV) up to rational coeﬃcients. This comes from the following
theorem, looking at primitive elements:
Theorem 2.2. Let D<n := ⊕2r+1<nD2r+1, n > 1. Then:
n = Qζ m (n) .

ker D<n ∩ HN

Proof. Straight-forward via the isomorphism of graded Hopf comodules (25), since the ana-
logue statement for H 2 is obviously true.

Nota Bene By this result proving an identity between motivic MZV (resp. MES), amounts to:
1. Prove that the coaction is identical on both sides, computing Dr for r > 0 smaller than
the weight. If the families are not stable under the coaction, this step would require other
identities.

2. Use the corresponding analytic result for MZV (resp. Euler sums) to deduce the remain-
ing rational coeﬃcient; if the analytic equivalent is unknown, we can at least evaluate
numerically this rational coeﬃcient.

Another important use of this corollary, is the decomposition of (motivic) multiple MZV into
a conjectured basis, which has been explained by F. Brown in [7]; similarly for MES.

2.3.3 Depth ﬁltration

and D2r+1(F D

Since these derivations Dr decrease the depth, it enables some depth recursion. Passing to the

As we will see in both section 4 and 5, for linear independance proof, an idea is to ﬁnd an
appropriate ﬁltration on the conjectural basis, such that the derivations in the graded space
act on this family, modulo some space, as deconcatenations.

A motivic ES is said to be unramiﬁed if it can be expressed as a Q-linear combinations of
is in H1; the corresponding ES is then also unramiﬁed, or honorary MZV from
MMZV, i.e.
D. Broadhurst terminology (cf. [5]).
From motivic theory, we have at our disposal a recursive criterion for MES to be unramiﬁed:II
Corollary 2.4. Let Z ∈ H2, a motivic Euler sum.
Then Z ∈ H1, i.e. Z is a motivic multiple zeta value if and only if:

D1(Z) = 0

and D2r+1(Z) ∈ H1.

It enables to prove than a (motivic) ES is unramiﬁed by recursion on depth and weight.
Some examples of unramiﬁed motivic ES, are provided in section 4 or in Appendix D, with
alternated patterns of even and odds.

IThis sum ‘(cid:80) ’, as a ‘ + ’ indicate that the absolute values are summed whereas the signs are multiplied.

IINote that this criterion has been generalised to MZV at other roots of unity : cf. [21] which looks at diﬀerent

Galois descents, and higher ramiﬁcation level.

Remarks:
· The Lie algebra of the fundamental group πdR
1 (M0,4) is generated
by e0, e1, e∞ with the only condition than e0 + e1 + e∞ = 0II. If we keep e0 and e∞ as
generators, instead of the usual e0, e1, it leads towards MMZV (cid:63)(cid:63) up to a sign, instead of
MMZV since −ω0 + ω1 − ω(cid:63) = 0. We could also choose e1 and e∞ as generators, which
leads to another version of MMZV, not well-spread.
· Euler (cid:63) sums, which already appear in the literature, correspond to the summation 1
with large inequalities:

the multiplication of series, was motivic but it is now proven for MII.III In particular, for

3.2 Antipode relation
We have at our disposal two combinatorial Hopf algebra structures, which lead to some so-
called antipodal relations for MES in the coalgebra L, i.e. modulo products.
First recall that if A is a graded connected bialgebra, there exists an unique antipode S leading
to a Hopf algebra structure: the graded map deﬁned by, using Sweedler notationsIV:

S(x) = −x −(cid:88)

S(x(1)) · x(2),

(35)

Hence, in the quotient A/A>0 · A>0: S(x) ≡ −x.

IAs before, the ‘ + ’ is a summation of absolute values while signs are multiplied.
IITo get rid of the 0 in front of the MZV, as in the last example, we use the shuﬄe regularisation 21.
IIIIt can be deduced from works by Goncharov on mixed Hodge structures, but was also proved directly by G.

Racinet, in his thesis, or I. Souderes in [37] via blow-ups.

IVThere, ∆(x) = 1 ⊗ x + x ⊗ 1 +(cid:80) x(1) ⊗ x(2) = ∆(cid:48)(x) + 1 ⊗ x + x ⊗ 1.

3.2.1 The  Hopf algebra
Let X = {a1,··· , an}. Then A := Q(cid:104)X×(cid:105) the Q-vector space of non commutative polyno-
mials in ai is a connected graded Hopf algebra, called the shuﬄe Hopf algebra, with the 
shuﬄe product, the deconcatenation coproduct ∆D and antipode S:

∆D(ai1 ··· ain ) =

ai1 ··· aik ⊗ aik+1 ··· ain , S(ai1 ··· ain ) = (−1)nain ··· ai1 .

(36)

k=0

Via the equivalence of category between Q-Hopf algebra and Q-Aﬃne group scheme, it corre-
sponds to:

G = SpecA : R → Hom(Q(cid:104)X(cid:105), R) = {S ∈ R(cid:104)(cid:104)ai(cid:105)(cid:105) | ∆S = S(cid:98)⊗S, (S) = 1},

(37)

where ∆ is the coproduct dual to : ∆(ai1 ··· ain ) = (1 ⊗ ai1 + ai1 ⊗ 1)··· (1 ⊗ ain + ain ⊗ 1).
Let restrict now to X = {0,−1, +1}. The shuﬄe relation for motivic Euler sums amounts to
say:

I m(0;·; 1) is a morphism of Hopf algebra from A to (R,×) :

(38)
Lemma 3.2 (Antipode ). In the coalgebra L, with w the weight, W any word in {0,±1},
{0,±(cid:63)} or {0,±(cid:93)}, and • standing for MES, MES(cid:63)(cid:63) or MES(cid:93)(cid:93):

This antipode  corresponds to a composition of path followed by a reverse of path in L.
Proof. For motivic iterated integrals: S(I m(0; a1, . . . , an; 1)) = (−1)nI m(0; an, . . . , a1; 1).I
Then, looking at the antipode recursive formula (35) in the coalgebra L:

S(I l(0; a1, . . . , an; 1)) ≡ −I l(0; a1, . . . , an; 1).

3.2.2 The ∗ Hopf algebra
Let Y = {··· , y−n, . . . , y−1, y1,··· , yn,···} an inﬁnite alphabet, and y0 = 1 the empty word.
Then A∗ := Q(cid:104)Y ×(cid:105) the non commutative polynomials in yi is a graded connected Hopf algebra
called the stuﬄe Hopf algebra, with the stuﬄe ∗ product and the coproduct:
yn1 ··· yni ⊗ yni+1 , . . . , ynp , ni ∈ Z
∗
The completed dual is the Hopf algebra of series Q(cid:104)(cid:104)Y (cid:105)(cid:105) with the coproduct:
|n|(cid:88)

∆D∗(yn1 ··· ynp ) =

(cid:88)

(39)

.

∆∗(yn) =

y1k ⊗ y2(n−k).

k=0

sign(n)=12

Stuﬄe for MES amounts to say that ζ m(·) is a morphism of Hopf algebra from A∗ to (R,×).
Now, let introduce the notations, with ni ∈ Z∗:II
(yn1 ··· ynp )(cid:63) :=

‘+’···‘+’nij+1−1 ··· ynik

‘+’···‘+’ni1−1 ··· ynij

‘+’···‘+’ni1−1 ··· ynij

‘+’···‘+’nij+1−1 ··· ynik

,

The operation ‘+’ still indicates that signs are multiplied whereas absolute values are summed.
It is straightforward to check that:

∆D∗(w(cid:63)) = (∆D∗(w))(cid:63),

and ∆D∗(w(cid:93)) = (∆D∗(w))(cid:93).

we deduce: S∗(yn1 ··· ynp ) = (−1)p(ynp ··· yn1 )(cid:63). Similarly:

i=0

p−1(cid:88)
(−1)i(yni ··· yn1 )(cid:63) ∗ (yni+1 ··· ynp ) = −(−1)p(ynp ··· yn1 )(cid:63),

i=0 (−1)i(yni ··· yn1 )(cid:93) ∗ (yni+1 ··· ynp )(cid:93)

= (−1)p(ynp ··· yn1 )(cid:93)

Since ζ m(·) is a morphism of Hopf algebra, the lemma straightly follows.

3.3 Hybrid relation in L
In this part, we look at a new relation called hybrid relation between motivic Euler sums in
the coalgebra L, i.e. modulo products, which comes from the motivic version of the octagon
relation (cf. [19])I. It corresponds to a contractible path in the moduli space of genus 0 curves
with 4 ordered marked points M0,4 = P1(cid:31){0,±1,∞}. Seeing the path on the Riemann sphere,
for ES, it is pictured by:

Figure 1: Octagon relation

This relation is motivic: it is valid for the motivic Drinfeld associator Φm (27) when replacing
2iπ by the Lefschetz motivic period Lm:
Lm e−1

Lm e0

−1e

Lm e∞2 Φm(e∞, e−1, e1) = 1
(41)

Remind that e0 + e1 + e−1 + e∞ = 0.
Let X = P1(cid:31){0,±1,∞}. The action of the real Frobenius F∞ on X(C) is induced by com-
plex conjugation. The real Frobenius acts on the Betti realization πB(X(C))II, and induces
an involution on motivic periods, compatible with the Galois action:

F∞ : P mMT (Z[ 1

]) → P mMT (Z[ 1

2

]).

2

The Lefschetz motivic period Lm is anti-invariant by F∞: F∞Lm = −Lm, whereas terms
corresponding to real paths in Figure 1, such as Drinfeld associator terms, are F∞-invariant.

Recall that the space of motivic periods of MT (cid:0)Z[ 1

2 ](cid:1) decomposes as (cf. 11):

P mMT (Z[ 1

2

]) = H2 ⊕ H2.Lm,

where H2 is F∞ invariant

H2.Lm is F∞ anti-invariant .

The linearized F∞-anti-invariant part of the octagon relation 41 leads to the following:

(42)

IThe hexagon relation for MZV (i.e. eiπe0 Φ(e∞, e0)eiπe∞ Φ(e1, e∞)eiπe1 Φ(e0, e1) = 1) turns to an octagon for

MZV at greater roots of unity. It is pictured by:

IIIt is compatible with the groupoid structure of πB, and the local monodromy.

The proof is given below, ﬁrstly for k = 0, using octagon relation (41). The generalization

for any k > 0 is deduced directly from the shuﬄe regularization (21).

Remarks:

· Equivalently, this statement is true for W any word in {0,±(cid:63)}, by linearity (cf. 34).
· The point of view adopted by Francis Brown in [9], and its use of commutative poly-
nomials (also seen in Ecalle work), applied in the coalgebra L leads to a new proof of
Theorem 3.4 in the case of MMZV only (not for MES).

Since Antipode ∗ expresses ζ l
n−1(np, . . . , n1) in terms of smaller depth
(cf. Lemma 3.3), a MES can be expressed by smaller depth when weight and depth have not
the same parity. This depth-drop phenomena, for motivic ES:I

− e1Φl(e1, e∞, e0) + Φl(e1, e∞, e0)e1 ≡ 0.

(44)

Proof.

(i) In order to deduce 43 from 41, let’s ﬁrst remark that:

0 ··· eηr ear

Indeed, the coeﬃcient in Φm(e1, e0, e∞) of a word ea0
is (cf. Appendice C):

Φm(e0, e1, e−1) = Φm(e1, e0, e∞)

0 eη1 ea1

Hence, summing over words w in e0, e1, e−1:

IErik Panzer recently generalised this parity theorem for MZV at roots of unity (not motivic there), which

appears as a special case of some functional equations of polylogarithms in several variables: [36].

Therefore:

Φm(e0, e1, e−1)Φm(e1, e0, e∞) =

w,w=uv

I m(0; u; 1)I m(1; v; 0)w = 1.

We used the composition formula for iterated integral to conclude, since for w non empty,

w=uv I m(0; u; 1)I m(1; v; 0) = I m(0; w; 0) = 0. Similarly:
Φm(e0, e−1, e1) = Φm(e−1, e0, e∞)

and Φm(e∞, e1, e−1) = Φm(e1, e∞, e0)

The ﬁrst line is zero (since e0 +e1 +e−1 +e∞ = 0) whereas each other line will contribute
by two terms, in order to give (44). Indeed, the projection πL(x), when seeing x as a
polynomial (with only even powers) in Lm, only keep the constant term; hence, for each
term, only one of the exponentials above ex contributes by its linear term i.e. x, while
the others contribute simply by 1. For instance, if we examine carefully the second line
of (46), we get:

(46)

= e0Φl(e−1, e0, e∞) + Φl(e−1, e0, e∞)(e−1 + e∞ + e1)

= 2(cid:2)e0Φl(e−1, e0, e∞) − Φl(e−1, e0, e∞)e0

−(−e0)Φl(e−1, e0, e∞) − Φl(e−1, e0, e∞)(−e−1 − e∞ − e1)

.

Similarly, the third line of (46) is equal to (e0 + e−1)Φl(e∞, e−1, e1)− Φl(e∞, e−1, e1)(e0 +
e−1) and the last line is equal to −e1Φl(e1, e∞, e0) + Φl(e1, e∞, e0)e1. Therefore, (46) is
equivalent to (44), as claimed.

This linearized octagon relation 44, while looking at the coeﬃcient of a speciﬁc word in
{e0, e1, e−1}, provides an identity between some ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l(•) and ζ l(•) in the coalgebra L. The
diﬀerent identities obtained in this way are detailed in Appendice C, and two of these are used
in the following proof.

where −W is obtained from W after exchanging (cid:93) and −(cid:93). Moreover, I l(0;−W ; 1) ≡
I l(0; W ;−1) ≡ −I l(−1; W ; 0). Hence, we obtain, using the composition rule of iterated
integrals modulo product:

I l(0; W ; 1) + I l(−1; W ; 0) ≡ I l(−1; W ; 1) ≡ 0.

4 Some Unramiﬁed Euler (cid:93) sums

Let’s look at the following family with only positive odd and negative even integers:

ζ(cid:93),m(cid:0){even , odd }×(cid:1).

In the iterated integral, this condition means that we see only the following sequences:

02a,

or

02a+1 − ,

with

 ∈ {±(cid:93)}.

It is the family of Euler sums appearing in the conjecture (6.1), and is unramiﬁed:

Theorem 4.1. The motivic Euler sums ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0){even , odd }×(cid:1) are motivic geometric+ periods

of MT (Z) and therefore Q linear combinations of motivic multiple zeta values.

The proof (§4.2) relies mainly upon the stability under the coaction of this family. This

(cid:111)

motivic family is even a generating family of motivic MZV:
Theorem 4.2. The following family is a basis of H1:

(cid:110)

B(cid:93) :=

ζ (cid:93),m(2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2) , ai ≥ 0

.

This family is conjecturally (Conjecture (6.1)) the Hoﬀman star family ζ (cid:63)(2a0 , 3,··· , 3, 2ap ).
The proof uses the increasing depth ﬁltration F D on H2:

It is not a grading but the associated graded is deﬁned as the quotient grD
vector space F D
p H is stable under the action of G. The linear independence of B(cid:93) elements is
proved below thanks to a recursion on the depth and on the weight, using the injectivity of a
map ∂ where ∂ came out of the depth and weight-graded part of the coaction ∆, and based
on the stability of B(cid:93) under the coaction.

p := F D

p (cid:30)F D

IThe weight w is the length of W, whereas the depth p is the number of ±(cid:93). Hence this condition is equivalent

for W to have an odd number of 0.

4.2 Proofs of Theorem 4.1 and 4.2
Proof of Theorem 4.1. By Corollary 2.4, we can prove it in two steps:

· First, it is rather obvious that D1(·) = 0 on this family since there is no sequence of the
type {0, ,−} or {,−, 0} in these iterated integrals.
· Secondly, we have to prove that D2r+1(·), for r > 0, are unramiﬁed for this family. This
follows straight, by recursion on weight, from this stability statement:

The family ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0){even , +odd }×(cid:1) is stable under D2r+1.

This is proved in Lemma A.3, using the relations of §.3 in order to get rid of the unstable
cuts, i.e. cuts where a sequence of type , 02a+1,  or , 02a,− appears (which corresponds
to a even or odd in the Euler (cid:93) sum).

One features used in the lemma about this family is: for a subsequence of odd length from the
iterated integral, because of these patterns of , 02a, , or , 02a+1,−, we can relate the depth
p, the weight w and s the number of sign changes among the ±(cid:93): w ≡ p − s (mod 2). Hence,
if we have a cut 0,··· p+1 of odd weight, then:
Either: Depth p is odd, s even, 0 = p+1, Or: Depth p is even, s odd, 0 = −p+1.

Proof of Theorem 4.2. By a cardinality argument, it is suﬃcient to prove the linear inde-
pendence of the family, which is based on the injectivity of ∂<n,p. Let us deﬁne:

Hodd(cid:93): Q-vector space generated by ζ (cid:93),m(2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2).
The ﬁrst point, thanks to Lemma A.4, is that Hodd(cid:93) is stable under these derivations:

) ⊂ L2r+1 ⊗ Hodd(cid:93)
Now, let consider the restriction on Hodd(cid:93) of ∂<n,p and prove:

∂<n,p : grD

The formula (51) gives the explicit expression of this map. Let us prove more precisely:
Claim 1: M D

n,p the matrix of ∂<n,p on(cid:8)ζ (cid:93),m(2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2)(cid:9)

n,p.

Nota Bene: The matrix M D
n,p is well (uniquely) deﬁned provided that the ζ (cid:93),m of the second
line are linearly independent. So ﬁrst, we have to consider the formal matrix associated MD
deﬁned explicitly (combinatorially) by the formula for the derivations given and prove MD
n,p is
invertible. Afterwards, we could state that M D
n,p is well deﬁned and invertible too since equal
to MD
Proof of Claim 1. The invertibility comes from the fact that the (strictly) smallest terms 2-
adically in (51) are the deconcatenation ones, which is an injective operation. More precisely,
n,p be the matrix Mn,p where we have multiplied each line corresponding to D2r+1 by
(2−2r). Then, order elements on both sides by lexicographical order on (ap, . . . , a0), resp.
(r, bp−1, . . . , b0), such that the diagonal corresponds to r = ap + 1 and bi = ai for i < p. The
2 -adic valuation of all the terms in (51) (once divided by 22r) is at least 1, except for the
deconcatenation terms since:

Then, modulo 2, only the deconcatenation terms remain, so the matrix (cid:102)M D

n,p is invertible, and so does MD

This allows us to complete the proof since it implies:

Claim 2: The elements of B(cid:93) are linearly independent.

23

Proof of Claim 2. First, let prove the linear independence of this family of the same depth
and weight, by recursion on p. Depth 0 is obvious since ζ m(2n) is a rational multiple of π2n.
Assuming by recursion on the depth that the elements of weight n and depth p − 1 are
linearly independent, since M D
n,p is invertible, this means both that the ζ (cid:93),m(2a0 + 1, 2a1 +
3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2) of weight n are linearly independent and that ∂<n,p is bijective, as
announced before.
The last step is just to realize that the bijectivity of ∂<n,l also implies that elements of diﬀerent
depths are also linearly independent. The proof could be done by contradiction: by applying
∂<n,p on a linear combination where p is the maximal depth appearing, we arrive at an equality
between same level elements.

5 Hoﬀman (cid:63) basis

Theorem 5.1. If the analytic conjecture (5.4) holds, then the motivic Hoﬀman (cid:63) family
{ζ (cid:63),m({2, 3}×)} is a basis of H1, the space of MMZV.
For that purpose, we deﬁne an increasing ﬁltration F L• on H2,3, called level, such that:

l H2,3 is spanned by ζ (cid:63),m(2a0 , 3,··· , 3, 2ap ), with less than ’l’ 3.
F L

(52)

It corresponds to the motivic depth for this family, as we see through the proof below.

Notably, the coaction on the Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements is stable. Moreover, the level ﬁltration is
stable under the action of G since each cut (of odd length) removes at least one 3:

on the 2-adic valuations of the coeﬃcients, only the deconcatenations terms remain. Hence,
with the previous order, the matrix is, modulo 2, triangular with 1 on the diagonal; the

Obviously, Claim 3 ⇒ Claim 2, but it will also enables us to complete the proof:
Proof of Claim 1. Let ﬁrst prove it for elements of a same level and weight, by recursion on
level. Level 0 is obvious: ζ (cid:63),m(2)n is a rational multiple of (πm)2n. Assuming that the Hoﬀman
(cid:63) elements of weight ≤ n and level l − 1 are linearly independent, since Mn,l is invertible, this
implies that the Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements of weight n and level l are linearly independent. The last
<n,l also implies that Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements of diﬀerent

levels are linearly independent. Indeed, proof can be done by contradiction: applying ∂L

a linear combination of Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements, l being the maximal number of 3, we arrive at an
equality between same level elements, and at a contradiction.

Before giving the proof, here is the (analytic) conjecture remaining on some of these coeﬃcients,

Conjecture 5.4. The equalities (v) are satisﬁed for real MZV, with:

Nota Bene: This conjecture is of an entirely diﬀerent nature from the techniques developed in
this thesis. We can expect that it can proved using analytic methods as the usual techniques
of identifying hypergeometric series, as in [40], or [31].
Theorem 5.5. If the analytic conjecture (5.4) holds, the equalities (iv), (v) are true in the
motivic case, with the same values of the coeﬃcients. In particular:

for the motivic identity (iv), we need the analytic version of (v).

(cid:26)

Proof. Remind that if we know a motivic equality up to one unknown coeﬃcient (of ζ(w)),
the analytic result analogue enables us to conclude on its value by Theorem 2.2.
Let assume now, in a recursion on n, that we know

Proof of Lemma 5.3.

:

Proof. Computing the coaction on these elements, by a recursive procedure, we are able to
prove these identities up to some rational coeﬃcients, with Theorem 2.2. When the analytic
analogue of the equality is known for MZV, we may conclude on the value of the remaining
rational coeﬃcient of ζ m(ω) by identiﬁcation (as for (i), (ii), (iii)). However, if the family is
not stable under the coaction (as for (iv)), knowing the analytic case is not enough.
Nota Bene: This proof refers to the expression of D2r+1 in Lemma A.1: we look at cuts of
length 2r + 1 among the sequence of 0, 1, or (cid:63) (in the iterated integral writing); there are
diﬀerent kind of cuts (according their extremities), and each cut may bring out two terms
(T0,0 and T0,(cid:63) for instance). The simpliﬁcations are illustrated by the diagrams, where some
arrows (term of a cut) get simpliﬁed by rules speciﬁed in Appendix A.

(i) The corresponding iterated integral is: I m(0; 1, 0, (cid:63), 0··· , (cid:63), 0; 1).

The only possible cuts of odd length are between two (cid:63) (T0,(cid:63) and T(cid:63),0) or T1,0 from the
ﬁrst 1 to a (cid:63), or T0,1 from a (cid:63) to the last 1. By Shift (73), these cuts get simpliﬁed two
by two. Since D2r+1(·), for 2r + 1 < 2n are all zero, it belongs to Qζ m(2n), by Theorem
2.2. Using the (known) analytic equality, we can conclude.

(ii) It is quite similar to (i): using Shift (73), it remains only the cut:

i.e. : D2r+1(ζ (cid:63),m

1

(2n)) = ζ l,(cid:63)

1 (2r) ⊗ ζ (cid:63),m(2n−r) = −2ζ l(2r + 1) ⊗ ζ (cid:63),m(2n−r).

The last equality is deduced from the recursive hypothesis (smaller weight). The analytic
equality (coming from the Zagier-Ohno formula, and the  regulation) enables us to
conclude on the value of the remaining coeﬃcient of ζ m(2n + 1).

(iii) Expressing these ES(cid:63)(cid:63) as a linear combination of ES by  regularisation:

a consequence of the sum relation for MZV of ﬁxed weight, depth and height, by Ohno

the analytic analogue of (35), with the same coeﬃcients dS and cr.
Now, using these analytic results for (34), (35), by recursion on the weight, we can identify
the coeﬃcient DS and Cr with resp. dS and cr, since there is one unknown coeﬃcient at
each step of the recursion.

Indeed, cyan arrows get simpliﬁed by Antipode , T0,0 resp. T0,(cid:63) above with T0,0 resp.

6 Motivic Linebarger Zhao conjecture

Conjecturally, each motivic MZV (cid:63) can be expressed as a motivic ES (cid:93) in the following way:
Conjecture 6.1. For ai, ci ∈ N∗, ci (cid:54)= 2, γi = ci − 3 + 2δci:

ζ (cid:63),m (2a0 , c1,··· , cp, 2ap ) = (−1)1+δc1 ζ (cid:93),m (B0, 1γ1 ,··· , 1γi , Bi, . . . , Bp) ,

 B0 := (−1)2a0−δc1 (2a0 + 1 − δc1 )

Bi := (−1)2ai−δci
Bp := (−1)2ap+1−δcp (2ap + 2 − δcp )

Nota Bene: The analytic version of this conjecture is proved: J. Zhao deduced it from its

Theorem 1.4 in [43].

Remarks:

· The Bi are then always positive odd or negative even integers.
· Motivic Euler (cid:93) sums appearing on the right side have already been proven to be unram-
iﬁed in Theorem 4.1, i.e. MMZV.
· This conjecture implies that the motivic Hoﬀman (cid:63) family is a basis, since it corresponds
to the motivic basis B(cid:93) of Theorem 4.2: cf. (69).
· The number of sequences of consecutive 1 in ζ (cid:63), n1 is linked with the number of even in
ζ (cid:93), ne, here: ne = 1 + 2n1 − 2δcp − δc1.

Special cases of this conjecture (references for proof for real ES indicated in the braket):

ζ (cid:63),m (2a0 , c1,··· , cp, 2ap ) = −ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0)2a0 + 1, 1c1−3,··· , 1ci−3, 2ai + 3, . . . , 2ap + 2(cid:1) (68)

ζ (cid:63),m(5, 6, 2) = −ζ (cid:93),m(1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1,−4)
ζ (cid:63),m(2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3) = −ζ (cid:93),m(3, 1,−2,−6,−2).

We paved the way for the proof of Conjecture 6.1, bringing it back to an identity in L:

Theorem 6.2. Let assume that in the coalgebra L, for odd weights:

(2a0−1, c1,··· , 2ap ) − ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l

1

B0−1(1γ1 ,··· , 1γp , Bp) ≡ ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l
ζ (cid:93),l

(2a0 , c1 − 1, . . . , 2ap ),
with c1 ≥ 3, a0 > 0, γi, Bi as above except Bp = (−1)2ap+δcp (2ap + 3 − δcp ). Then:
(i) Conjecture 6.1 is true.
(ii) In the coalgebra L, for odd weights, with c1 ≥ 3 and the previous notations:

(70)

ζ (cid:93),l(1γ1 ,··· , 1γp , Bp) ≡ −ζ (cid:63),l

1 (c1 − 1, 2a1 , c2,··· , cp, 2ap ).

(71)

Proof. The proof, rather tedious, is hence given in Appendix E.

Remark: This hypothesis (only valid L2, not in H2) should be proven either directly via
the various relations in L proven in section 3 (as for 71), or using the coaction, which would
require the analytic identity corresponding.

Proof. The proof is straightforward from (29), using the linearity (by 34) in both ways:
(i) First, to turn  into a diﬀerence of ±1 minus 0 in order to use (29).
(ii) Then, in the right side, a ±1 appeared inside the iterated integral when looking at the
usual coaction formula which is turned into a sum of a term with  (denoted T,0 or T0,)
and a term with 0 (denoted T0,0) by linearity of the iterated integrals and in order to
end up only with 0,  in the right side.

Once listing the diﬀerent cuts, we found the expression of the lemma, since:

· The ﬁrst line corresponds to the initial cut (from the s + 1 ﬁrst 0).
· The second line corresponds to a cut either from ± to 0; the ± being ±1.
· The third line corresponds to a cut from 0 to ±.
· The fourth line corresponds to cut from  to , with two choices: a  being ﬁxed to 0, the
other one ﬁxed to 1. Replacing 1 by () + (0), this leads to a T0,, a T,0 and two T0,0
terms which get simpliﬁed together.
· The last lines correspond to cuts from  to −, with three possibilities: one being ﬁxed
to 0, the other one ﬁxed to ±1, or the ﬁrst being 1, the second −1. This leads to a T,0,
a T0,− and a T,−, since the T0,0 terms get simpliﬁed.

IFor purpose of stability: if there is a ±1 at the beginning, as for (cid:63) or (cid:93) versions, the cut with this ﬁrst ±1 will be
let as a T±1,0 term (and not converted into a T,0 less a T0,0), in order to still have a ±1 at the beginning; whereas,
if there is no ±1 at the beginning, as for (cid:63)(cid:63) or (cid:93)(cid:93) version even the ﬁrst cut (ﬁrst line) has to be converted into a T0,
less a T0,0, in order to still have a  at the beginning.

33

A.1 Simpliﬁcation rules
Thanks to some relations (§3) between MES in the coalgebra L applied to its left side, the
coaction for some MES may be simpliﬁed.

Notations: We use the notation of the iterated integrals inner sequences and represent a
term of a cut in D2r+1 (cf. Lemma A.1) by arrows between two elements of this sequence.
The weight of the cut (which is the length of the subsequence in the iterated integral) would
always be considered odd here. We gather here terms in D2r+1 according to their right side
and the diagrams show which terms get simpliﬁed together: i.e. terms which have same right
side, but opposite left side, by antipodal and hybrid relations.

Composition : The composition rule (§.2.2) in the coalgebra L boils down to:
with X any sequence of 0,±1,±(cid:63),±(cid:93).

(72)
It allows us to switch the two extremities of the integral if we multiply by −1 the integral:
this exchange is considerably used below, without mentioning.

I l(a; X; b) ≡ −I l(b; X; a),

Antipode : It corresponds to a reversal of path for iterated integrals (cf. 3.2):

I l(a; X; b) ≡ (−1)wI l(b; (cid:101)X; a) for any X sequence of 0,±1,±(cid:63),±(cid:93). Hence:

· If X symmetric, i.e. (cid:101)X = X, these two cuts get simpliﬁed,
since I l(; Xi+1; 0) ≡ −I l(0; i+1(cid:101)X; ) ≡ −I l(0; i+1X; ).
· If X antisymmetric, i.e. (cid:101)X = −X,the cut
≡ I l(; X; 0) − I l(−; (cid:101)X; 0)

I l(; X;−) ≡ I l(; X; 0) + I l(0; X;−)
≡ I l(; X; 0) − I l(−;−X; 0)
≡ 0

Proof. We look at cuts of odd interior length between two elements of the sequence inside 78.
By Shift, the following cuts of same colors get simpliﬁed, above with below:I

IHere δr imposes that the left side must have a weight equal to 2r + 1.
IMore precisely, in the ﬁrst diagram: T0,0 resp. T0,(cid:63) above get simpliﬁed with T0,0 resp. T(cid:63),0 below (shifted by

one at the right). The dotted arrows mean that if ci = 1 resp. cj = 1, only T0,0 get simpliﬁed.

Proof. Looking at the possible cuts, and gathering them according the right side:

These cuts have the same form for the right side in the coaction:

I m(0;··· , i0αj,··· ; 1).

Notice there would be no term T,− in a cut from  to − thanks to Sign (77) identity, there-
fore you have there all the possible cuts pictured.

A priori, cuts can create in the right side a sequence {, 0even,−} or (cid:8), 0odd, (cid:9) inside the

iterated integral; these cuts are the unstable ones, since they are out of the considered family.
However, by coupling these cuts two by two, and using the rules listed at the beginning of the
Appendix, the unstable cuts would all get simpliﬁed.
Indeed, let examine each of the terms (1 − 6)I:

where δr imposes (weight of left side = 2r + 1) and B is positive if odd, negative if even.

Proof. Nota Bene: For the left side, we only look at odd weight w, and the parity of the depth
d is fundamental since the relations stated above depend on the parity of w − d. For instance,
for such a sequence (1γi , Bi, . . . , Bj−1, 1γj ) (with the previous notations), weight − depth has
the same parity than δci + δcj .
The following cuts get simpliﬁed, with Shift, since depth is odd (Bi odd if ci, ci+1 (cid:54)= 1):

(iv) ζ (cid:93),m(B0 ··· , 1γi+1 , B, 1γ, Bj+1, . . . , Bp).
It remains, where (iv) terms, antisymmetric of (i), are omitted to lighten the diagrams:

Now, let list these remaining terms, gathered according to their right side as above:
(i) Looking at the magenta terms, with 2 ≤ B ≤ Bj − 1 or B = Bj + 1 and 0 ≤ γ ≤ γi+1 − 1:

Bj−B+1(1γj , . . . , 1γi+1−γ−1)−ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
With even depth for the ﬁrst term and odd for the second since otherwise the cuts would
be unstable and simpliﬁed by Cut; here also ci+1 (cid:54)= 1.

Bj−B(1γj , . . . , 1γi+1−γ) = −ζ (cid:93),l(Bj−B+1, 1γj , . . . , 1γi+1−γ−1)

(ii) This matches exactly with the left side of (i) for B = Bj and (iv) terms for B = Bi.
(iii) The following cuts:

δBi+1≥Bζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

δBi+1<Bζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

Bi+1−B(1γi+2 , . . . , Bj) − δBj≥Bζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

Bi+1+Bj−B(1γi+2 , . . . , 1γj ).

The parity of weight − depth for the ﬁrst line is equal to the parity of δci+1 + δcj+1 + B.
Notice that if this is even, the ﬁrst line has odd depth whereas the second line has even
depth, and by Cut and Antipode∗, all terms got simpliﬁed. Hence, we can restrict to
B written as 2β + 3 − δci+1 − δcj+1, the ﬁrst line being of even depth, the second line of
odd depth.

(iv) Antisymmetric of (i).

Lemma C.1. In the coalgebra L, ni ∈ Z∗:I

Proof. The sign of ni is denoted i as usual. First, we remark that, with ηi = ±1, ni =
i(ai + 1), and i = ηiηi+1:

(i) This case is the one used in Theorem 3.4. This identity is equivalent to, in terms of

iterated integrals, for X any sequence of {0,±1} or of {0,±(cid:63)}:

I l(0; 0k,−(cid:63), X; 1) = I l(0;−X,−(cid:63), 0k; 1)

The ﬁrst case is deduced from 44 when looking at the coeﬃcient of a word beginning
and ending by e−1 (or beginning and ending by e1), whereas the second case is obtained
from the coeﬃcient of a word beginning by e−1 and ending by e1, or beginning by e1 and
ending by e−1.

(ii) Let split into two cases, according to the sign of(cid:81) i:

· In 44, when looking at the coeﬃcient of a word beginning by e1 and ending by e0,
only these three terms contribute:

Φl(e−1, e0, e∞)e0 − Φl(e∞, e−1, e1)e0 − e1Φl(e1, e∞, e0).

Moreover, the coeﬃcient of e−1ea0

is, using the expressions above for

(−1)pI l(0;−1,−X; 1) + (−1)w+1I l(0;−(cid:63),−X(cid:63); 1) + (−1)wI l(0; X(cid:63), 0; 1) = 0,

In terms of motivic Euler sums, it is, with(cid:81) i = 1:

Changing np into −np, and applying Antipode  to the last term, it gives, with

n0−1(n1,··· , np−1, np‘+’1) = 0.

ζ l(n0,··· , np) + (−1)w+pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l(n0,··· , np) + (−1)pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l

np (np−1,··· , n1, n0) = 0.

· Similarly, for the coeﬃcient of a word beginning by e−1 and ending by e0, only these
three terms contribute:

Φl(e−1, e0, e∞)e0 − Φl(e∞, e−1, e1)e0 + e−1Φl(e∞, e−1, e1).

Similarly than above, it leads to the identity, with(cid:81) i = −1:
now(cid:81) i = 1:

ζ l(n0,··· ,−np)+(−1)w+pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l(n0,··· ,−np)+(−1)w+pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l
Changing np into −np, and applying Antipode  to the last term, it gives, with

n0−1(n1,··· , np−1,−(np‘+’1)) = 0.

ζ l(n0,··· , np) + (−1)w+p+1ζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l(n0,··· , np) + (−1)pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l

np (np−1,··· , n1, n0) = 0.

(iii) When looking at the coeﬃcient of a word beginning by e0 and ending by e0 in 44, only

these three terms contribute:

D Some unramiﬁed ES up to depth 5.

The proof relies upon the criterion 2.4, which enables us to construct inﬁnite families of un-
ramiﬁed Euler sums with parity patterns by iteration on the depth, up to depth 5.

Notations: The occurrences of the symbols E or O can denote arbitrary even or odd in-
tegers, whereas every repeated occurrence of symbols Ei (respectively Oi) denotes the same
positive even (resp. odd) integer. The bracket {·, . . . ,·} means that every permutation of the
listed elements is allowed.
Theorem D.1. The following motivic Euler sums are unramiﬁed, i.e. motivic MZV:I

ζ m(E, O, O, E), ζ m(O, E, O, E),
ζ m(O, E, E, O), ζ m(E, O, E, O)

Depth 4
Depth 5
Similarly for these linear combinations, in depth 2 or 3:

ζ m(O1, E1, O1, E1, O1).

ζ m(n1, n2) + ζ m(n2, n1), ζ m(n1, n2) + ζ m(n1, n2), ζ m(n1, n2) − ζ m(n2, n1).

(2n1 − 1)ζ m(n1, 1) + (2n1−1 − 1)ζ m(1, n1).

ζ m(n1, n2, n3) + (−1)n1−1ζ m(n3, n2, n1) with n2 + n3 odd .

IBeware, here, O and n must be diﬀerent from 1, whereas O and n may be 1. There is no 1 allowed in these

terms if not explicitly written.

43

Examples: These motivic Euler sums are motivic multiple zeta values:

ζ m(25, 14, 17), ζ m(17, 14, 17), ζ m(24, 14, 24), ζ m(6, 23, 17, 10), ζ m(13, 24, 13, 24, 13).

Remarks:

· This result for motivic ES implies the analogue statement for ES.
· Notice that for each honorary MZV above, the reverse sum is honorary too, which was
not obvious a priori, since the condition c1 below is not symmetric.

Proof. The proof amounts to the straight-forward control that D1(·) = 0 (immediate) and that
all the elements appearing in the right side of D2r+1 are unramiﬁed, by recursion on depth:
here, these elements satisfy the suﬃcient criteria given below. Let only point out a few things,
referring to the expression (83):
Terms c: The symmetry condition (c4), obviously true for these single elements above, get
rid of these terms. For the few linear combinations of MES given, the cuts of type (c)
get simpliﬁed together.

Terms a,b: Checking that the right sides are unramiﬁed is straightforward by depth-recursion
hypothesis, since only the (previously proven) unramiﬁed elements of lower depth emerge.
For example, the possible right sides (not canceled by a symmetric cut and up to reversal
symmetry) are listed below, for some elements from depth 3.

Suﬃcient condition. Let Z = ζ m(n1, . . . , np) a motivic Euler sum. These four conditions
are suﬃcient for Z to be unramiﬁed:
c1 : No 1 in Z.
c2 : For each (n1, . . . , ni) of odd weight, the MES ζ m(ni+1, . . . , np) is a MMZV.
c3 : If a cut removes an odd-weight part (such that there is no symmetric cut possible), the

c4 : Each sub-sequence (ni, . . . , nj) of even weight such that(cid:81)j

remaining MES (right side in terms a,b), is a MMZV.

k=i k (cid:54)= 1 is symmetric.

Proof. The condition c1 implies that D1(Z) = 0; conditions c2, resp. c3 take care that the
right side of terms a0, resp. a,b are unramiﬁed, while the condition c4 cancels the (disturbing)
terms c: indeed, a single ES with an 1 can not be unramiﬁed.
Note that a MES Z of depth 2, weight n is unramiﬁed if and only if

(cid:26) D1(Z) = 0

.

Dn−1(Z) = 0

44

Nota Bene: This criterion is not necessary: it does not cover the unramiﬁed Q-linear combi-
nations of motivic ES, such as those presented in section 4, neither some isolated (symmetric
enough) examples where the unramiﬁed terms appearing in D2r+1 could cancel between them.
However, it embrace general families of single Euler sums which are unramiﬁed.
Nevertheless,

If we comply with these conditions, the only general families of single MES obtained

are the one listed in Theorem D.1.

Sketch of the proof. Notice ﬁrst that the condition c4 implies in particular that there are no
consecutive sequences of the type (since it would create type c terms):

Seq. not allowed : OO, OO, EE, EE.

It implies, from depth 3, that we can’t have the sequences (otherwise one of the non allowed
depth 2 sequences above appear in a,b terms):

Seq. not allowed : EEO, EEEO, EEOE, EOE, EEO, OEE, EOE, EOE, OOO.

Going on in this recursive way, carefully, leads to the previous theorem.
For instance, let Z a MES of even weight, with no 1, and let detail two cases:
Depth 3: The right side of D2r+1 has odd weight and depth smaller than 2, hence is always
MMZV if there is no 1 by depth 2 results. It boils down to the condition c4: Z must be
either symmetric (such as O1EO1 or E1EE1 with possibly one or three overlines) either
have exactly two overlines. Using the analysis above of the allowed sequences in depth 2
and 3 for condition c3,4 leads to the following:

(E, O, O), (O, O, E), (O, E, O), (O, E, O), (O, E, O), (O1, E, O1), (O1, E, O1), (E1, E, E1).
Depth 4: Let Z = ζ m (n1, . . . , n4), i = sign(ni). To avoid terms of type c with a right side of
depth 1: if 123 (cid:54)= 1, either n1 + n2 + n3 is odd, or n1 = n3 and 2 = −1; if 234 (cid:54)= 1,
either n2 + n3 + n4 is odd, or n2 = n4 and 3 = −1. The following sequences are then
not allowed:

(E, O, O, E), (E, O, O, E), (E, O, E, O), (E, E, O, O), (O, O, E, E).

E Proof of Theorem 6.2

To prove the identity of conjecture 6.1 of Theorem 6.2, we would need to prove, by recursion,
that the coaction is equal on both side, and use the analytic version to conclude. We prove (i)
and (ii) successively, in a same recursion on the weight:

(i) Using the formulas of the coactions Dr for these families (Lemma A.2 and A.4), we can

gather terms in both sides according to the right side, which leads to three types:
ζ (cid:63),m(··· , 2ai , α, 2β, cj+1,··· )
←→ ζ (cid:93),m(B0 ··· , Bi, 1γ, B, 1γj+1 , . . . , Bp)
ζ (cid:63),m(··· , 2ai−1 , ci, 2β, cj+1,··· ) ←→ ζ (cid:93),m(B0 ··· , Bi−1, 1γi , B, 1γj+1 , . . . , Bp)
ζ (cid:63),m(··· , ci, 2β, α, 2aj ,··· )
←→ ζ (cid:93),m(B0 ··· , 1γi+1 , B, 1γ, Bj+1, . . . , Bp)

(a)
(b)
(c)
with γ = α − 3 and B = 2β + 3 − δcj+1, or B = 2β + 3 − δci − δcj+1 for (b).
The third case, antisymmetric of the ﬁrst case, may be omitted below. By recursive
hypothesis, these right sides are equal and it remains to compare the left sides associated:

This boils down to (70) applied to each ζ (cid:63)(cid:63)
of the type ζ (cid:63)(cid:63)
· Let now look at the case where ci = 1, cj+1 > 3 II; hence Bi = 2ai + 2− δci+1,
B = 2β + 2. In a ﬁrst hand, we have to consider:

By renumbering indices in 84, the correspondence boils down here to the

B = 2β + 2:

B0−1(Bp − B + 2, 1γp ,··· , 1γ1 ).

Furthermore, applying the recursion hypothesis (i), i.e. conjecture 6.1 on
((cid:5)3), and turn it into a diﬀerence of ζ (cid:93)(cid:93):

−ζ (cid:63),l(2a0+1, c1,··· , cp, 2ap−β)

((cid:5)3)

≡ −ζ (cid:93),l(Bp − B + 1, 1γp ,··· , 1γ1 , B0)
≡ −ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(Bp − B + 1, 1γp ,··· , 1γ1 , B0) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

Bp−B+1(1γp ,··· , 1γ1 , B0)
When adding ((cid:5)2) and ((cid:5)3) to get ((cid:5)), the two last terms (odd depth) being
simpliﬁed by Shift, it remains:

((cid:5))

B0−B+1(Bp, 1γp ,··· , 1γ1 ) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(Bp − B + 1, 1γp ,··· , 1γ1 , B0).
ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

This, applying Antipode ∗ to the ﬁrst term, Cut and Shift to the second,
corresponds to (1).

(b) When β > aj > ai, we should have:

−ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l
≡ +ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

cj−2(2aj−1 , . . . , 2ai+aj−β+1) +ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l
−ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
Bi+Bj−B(1γj , . . . , 1γi+1 )

ci+1−2(2ai+1 , . . . , 2ai+aj−β+1)
Bi+Bj−B(1γi+1 , . . . , 1γj ).

Using Shift (73) for the ﬁrst line, and renumbering the indices, it is equivalent
to, with c1, cp ≥ 3 and a0 > 0:

ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l
1

(2a0 , c1 − 1,··· , cp) − ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l

1

(2a0 , c1,··· , cp − 1)

(85)

≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

B0+2(1γ1 ,··· , 1γp ) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

B0+2(1γp ,··· , 1γ1 ) ≡ ζ (cid:93),l

B0+2(1γ1 , . . . , 1γp ).

The last equality comes from Corollary 3.8, since depth is even. By (86) applied
on each term of the ﬁrst line

ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l
1
(2a0−1, c1,··· , cp)+ζ (cid:93)l

2a0

(2a0 , c1 − 1,··· , cp) − ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l
(3, 1γp ,··· , 1γ1 )−ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l

(2a0 , c1,··· , cp − 1)
(cp,··· , c1, 2a0−1)−ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

1

2

2

≡ ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l

2

(2a0+1, 1γp ,··· , 1γ1 ).

By Antipode , the ζ (cid:63)(cid:63) get simpliﬁed, and by the deﬁnition of ζ (cid:93)(cid:93), the previous
equality is equal to:

≡ −ζ (cid:93)l

2a0+3(1γp ,··· , 1γ1 ) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93)l

2a0

(3, 1γp ,··· , 1γ1 ) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93)l

2a0+4(1γp−1,··· , 1γ1 )

−ζ (cid:93)(cid:93)l

2 (2a0 + 1, 1γp ,··· , 1γ1 ) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93)l

2a0+3(1γr ,··· , 1γ1 ).

Then, by Shift (73), the second and fourth term get simpliﬁed while the third
and ﬁfth term get simpliﬁed by Cut (74). It remains:

which leads straight to 85.

−ζ (cid:93),l

2a0+3(1γp ,··· , 1γ1 ),
(c) When ai < β < aj, we should have:
(2ai , . . . , 2aj−β−1) + ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l
≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

− ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l

2

ci+1−2(2ai+1 , . . . , 2ai+aj−β+1)
Bi+Bj−B(1γj , . . . , 1γi+1 ) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

Bj−B(1γj , . . . , Bi).

Using resp. Antipode Shift (73) for the ﬁrst line, and re-ordering the indices,
it is equivalent to, with c1 ≥ 3, B0 = 2a0 + 1 − δc1 here:

ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l
2

(2a0−1, c1,··· , cp, 2ap ) − ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l

Bp−1(B0, 1γ1 ,··· , 1γp ) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

(86)
≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
B0−1(1γ1 ,··· , 1γp , Bp).
This matches with the identity 70; the last equality coming from Shift since
depth is odd.

B0+Bp−1(1γp ,··· , 1γ1 ) ≡ ζ (cid:93),l

(2a0 , c1 − 1,··· , cp, 2ap )

3. Antisymmetric of the ﬁrst case.

(ii) Let us denote the sequences X = 2a1 , . . . , 2ap and Y = 1γ1−1, B1,··· , 1γp.

We want to prove that:

ζ (cid:93),l(1, Y, Bp) ≡ −ζ (cid:63),l

1 (c1 − 1, X)

(87)

Relations used are mostly these stated in Section 3. Using the deﬁnition of ζ (cid:63)(cid:63):
−ζ (cid:63),l

1 (c1 − 1, X) ≡ −ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l

(c1 − 1, X) + ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l

c1 (X)

1

≡ −ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l(1, c1 − 1, X) + ζ (cid:63),l(1, c1 − 1, X) + ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l(c1, X) − ζ (cid:63),l(c1, X)
≡ ζ (cid:63),l(1, c1 − 1, X) − ζ (cid:63),l(c1, X) − ζ (cid:63),l(c1 − 1, X, 1).

(88)
There, the ﬁrst and third term in the second line, after applying Shift, have given the
last ζ (cid:63) in the last line.
Using then Conjecture 6.1, in terms of MMZV(cid:93), then MMZV(cid:93)(cid:93), it gives:

ζ (cid:93),l(2, Y, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93),l(1, 1, Y, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93),l(1, Y, Bp − 1, 1)

≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(2, Y, Bp − 1) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

(Y, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(1, 1, Y, Bp − 1)

2

− ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

(1, Y, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(1, Y, Bp − 1, 1) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

(Y, Bp − 1, 1)

(89)

1

First term (odd depth)I is simpliﬁed with the last, by Schift. Fifth term (even depth)
get simpliﬁed by Cut with the fourth term. Hence it remains two terms of even depth:

≡ −ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

2

(Y, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(1, 1, Y, Bp − 1) ≡ −ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

1

(Y, Bp) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

Bp−1(1, 1, Y),

where Minus resp. Cut have been applied. This matches with (87) since, by Shift :

≡ −ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

1

(Y, Bp) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(1, Y, Bp) ≡ ζ (cid:93),l(1, Y, Bp).

1 (2, X) ≡ ζ (cid:93),l(B1 + 1, Y(cid:48)

The case c1 = 3 slightly diﬀers since (88) gives, by recursion hypothesis I.(6.1):
, Bp − 1, 1),
−ζ (cid:63),l
where Y(cid:48) = 1γ2 ,··· , 1γp, odd depth. Turning into MES(cid:93)(cid:93), and using identities of §3. in
the same way than above, leads to the result. Indeed, from:

, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93),l(1, B1, Y(cid:48)

, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93),l(B1, Y(cid:48)

≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(B1 + 1, Y(cid:48)
B1+1(Y(cid:48)

−ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(1, B1, Y(cid:48)
, Bp − 1) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

(B1, Y(cid:48)

1

, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(B1, Y(cid:48)

, Bp − 1, 1)

, Bp − 1) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

(Y(cid:48)

, Bp − 1, 1)

B1

First and last terms get simpliﬁed via Shift, while third and ﬁfth term get simpliﬁed
by Cut; besides, we apply minus for second term, and minus for the fourth term, which
are both of even depth. This leads to 71, using again Shift for the ﬁrst term:

≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
Bp−1(1, B1, Y(cid:48)) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(B1, Y(cid:48), Bp) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
≡ ζ (cid:93),l(B1, Y(cid:48), Bp).

B1

B1

(Y(cid:48), Bp)
(Y(cid:48), Bp)

This ends the proof.

F Missing coeﬃcients

In Lemma 5.3(v), the coeﬃcients Da,b appearing are the only one which are not conjectured.
Albeit these values are not required for the proof of Theorem 5.1, let present here a table of
values in small weights for them. Let examine the coeﬃcient corresponding to ζ (cid:63)(2n) instead
of ζ (cid:63)(2)n, which is (by (i) in Lemma 5.3), with n = a + b + 1:

(cid:101)Da,b :=

(2n)!

6n | B2n | (22n − 2)

and

(2n)!

(cid:101)Dn :=

ISince weight is odd, we know also depth parity of these terms.

We have an expression (65) for Dn, albeit not very elegant, which would give:
