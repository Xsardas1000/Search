Entangled states are a crucial resource for quantum-based technologies such

as quantum computers and quantum communication systems [1, 2]. Exploring

new methods for entanglement generation is important for diversifying and

eventually improving current approaches. Here, we create entanglement in

atomic ions by applying laser ﬁelds to constrain the evolution to a restricted

number of states, in an approach that has become known as “quantum Zeno

dynamics” [3, 4, 5]. With two trapped 9Be+ ions, we obtain Bell state ﬁdelities

1

up to 0.990+2−5; with three ions, a W-state [6] ﬁdelity of 0.910+4−7 is obtained.
Compared to other methods of producing entanglement in trapped ions, this

procedure is relatively insensitive to certain imperfections such as ﬂuctuations

in laser intensity, laser frequency, and ion-motion frequencies.

The quantum Zeno effect usually refers to the inhibition of quantum dynamics due to fre-

quent measurements [7, 8, 9]. More generally, the idea is to restrict the dynamics to a subspace

of the overall system. Recent proposals [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] have explored ways to

provide this subspace isolation by coupling the remainder of the system to auxiliary quantum

states. This situation has become known as quantum Zeno dynamics, though the restrictions

can be implemented by unitary interactions without the need for measurements. Dynamics in a

restricted subspace have recently been demonstrated with atoms in Bose-Einstein condensates

[18], Rydberg atoms [19, 20], atoms in a cavity [21] and photons in a cavity coupled to a su-

perconducting qubit [22]. Here, we apply coherent laser ﬁelds to trapped ions to conﬁne their

quantum evolution to an effective two-level subspace consisting of an initial product state and

an entangled state. With this Hilbert space engineering, we prepare an entangled state by apply-

ing a spatially uniform microwave control pulse to a collection of ions initially in a separable

state. This technique can produce high ﬁdelity entangled states with resilience to technical laser

noise and ﬂuctuations of the frequencies of ion motion. For measurement-based Zeno dynam-

ics, there is a ﬁnite probability of irretrievably escaping from the desired subspace. However, if

the subspace restriction is brought about by coherent interactions, the evolution is ideally uni-

tary, and thus state amplitudes that leak from the restricted subspace remain coherent and can be

recovered with additional coherent operations. We demonstrate this advantage of coherent sub-

space engineering by applying a composite pulse sequence, and observe an improved ﬁdelity of

the entangled state.

When applying a global rotation to an initial state with N two-level (spin- 1

2) systems in

2

the spin up state |↑(cid:105), each spin rotates independently and the overall quantum state remains
separable. The evolution can be described in the symmetric angular momentum manifold
|J = N/2, mJ(cid:105) [23], or Dicke states [24], where J is the total angular momentum quantum
number and mJ is the projection of the angular momentum along the quantization axis. All
individual |J, mJ(cid:105) states are entangled states except the maximal spin states, |↑↑ ... ↑(cid:105) = |J, J(cid:105)
and |↓↓ ... ↓(cid:105) = |J,−J(cid:105). Entanglement between multiple spins can be generated by perturbing
speciﬁc |J, mJ(cid:105) states in the manifold to restrict the dynamics. A simple case is to apply a
perturbation to shift the |J, J − 2(cid:105) state out of resonance, as depicted in Fig. 1 for the case of
two spins. In this case, the dynamics are restricted within the |J, J(cid:105) and |J, J − 1(cid:105) states. Thus,
starting from |J, J(cid:105), the entangled |J, J − 1(cid:105) state [25, 6] is prepared by an effective π-pulse.
For two and three spins, these states are the triplet Bell state |T(cid:105) = 1√
(|↑↓(cid:105) + |↓↑(cid:105)) and the
W-state [6] |W(cid:105) = 1√

(|↑↑↓(cid:105) + |↑↓↑(cid:105) + |↓↑↑(cid:105)), respectively.

We experimentally demonstrate this scheme with trapped 9Be+ ions aligned along the axis

of a linear Paul trap [26, 27, 28]. In an applied magnetic ﬁeld of 11.946 mT, the frequency
splitting ω0 ≈ 2π × 1.2075 GHz between the 2S1/2 hyperﬁne ground states |F = 2, mF = 0(cid:105) ≡
|↓(cid:105) and |F = 1, mF = 1(cid:105) ≡ |↑(cid:105) is ﬁrst-order insensitive to magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations [29]. The
effective rotation in the restricted subspace is produced by a uniform resonant microwave ﬁeld,

while the restricting perturbations are provided by a laser-induced coupling between ions via

a shared motional mode. With two ions and without applied laser ﬁelds, the microwave ﬁeld

couples the Dicke states with the Hamiltonian

where  is the reduced Planck constant, Ωd is the single-ion Rabi frequency, σx

product state, evolution under this Hamiltonian will not generate entanglement.

microwave coupling; the thick blue arrows depict laser-induced strong blue sideband coupling.
With the |↑↑(cid:105) state initially populated (red dots), in the absence of the sideband excitation,
the microwaves drive the state down the symmetric manifold (the states on the left) with Rabi
frequency Ωd, where the |T(cid:105) and |S(cid:105) states are deﬁned in the text, and such a global rotation
alone cannot generate entanglement. However, the sideband excitations (with Rabi frequency
Ωs) dress the |↓↓(cid:105) state, shifting its components out of resonance with respect to the weak
microwave drive, as shown on the right. Thus given Ωs (cid:29) Ωd, the microwave drive only
couples the two highest energy states in the symmetric manifold, and the entangled |T(cid:105) state

To generate the desired dynamics for two ions, we address the “stretch” axial normal mode
of motion of frequency ω ≈ 2π × 6.20 MHz, with a laser-induced stimulated-Raman blue
sideband interaction [30]. The sideband interaction is detuned from resonance by δ, and is

described by the Hamiltonian

i =
|↓(cid:105)i(cid:104)↑| is the spin lowering operator for ion i. In Eq. (2), we have assumed that the Raman
phase on the two ions is the same (modulo 2π). The minus sign between the two spin lowering

2

operators results from the stretch-mode amplitudes being equal but opposite for the two ions.
The symmetry of the |T, n(cid:105) state implies that the sideband interaction does not couple this
state to other relevant states. However, as depicted on the left in Fig. 1, it couples the states
|↓↓(cid:105)|n(cid:105) ↔ |S(cid:105)|n + 1(cid:105) ↔ |↑↑(cid:105)|n + 2(cid:105), where |n(cid:105) denotes a stretch mode Fock state, and
(|↑↓(cid:105) − |↓↑(cid:105)). The energies of the resulting dressed states (the eigenstates of the ions
|S(cid:105) = 1√
with Hs included) are shifted to approximately ±Ωs and 4Ωs (right hand side of Fig. 1),
√
2Ωs [30], so that the energy shift can be made
when the detuning δ is set to approximately
large compared to Ωd for Ωs (cid:29) Ωd. In addition, Hs couples |↑↑, n(cid:105) to |S, n − 1(cid:105) for n > 0,
but these couplings are absent if we initialize the stretch mode in the ground state n = 0. If
Ωs (cid:29) Ωd, the system evolves as an effective two-level system between |↑↑(cid:105)|0(cid:105) and |T(cid:105)|0(cid:105)
under the combined inﬂuence of Hs and Hd, within a subspace isolated from other states. This
allows the preparation of the entangled state |T(cid:105)|0(cid:105) by a single effective π−pulse from |↑↑(cid:105)|0(cid:105).
However, for n > 0, the desired subspace will not be isolated; therefore, high ﬁdelity motional

ground state preparation is crucial [30].

To initialize the spin and motional states, we ﬁrst sideband cool both axial modes of the ions

to near the ground state, achieving average motional occupation of ¯n < 0.006 for the stretch
mode [31]. Optical pumping prepares both ions in the |F = 2, mF = 2(cid:105) atomic state. We then
apply a global composite microwave π-pulse to initialize to the |↑↑(cid:105) state [30, 32]. We set the
laser beam and microwave intensities to give Ωs ≈ 2π × 17.6 kHz and Ωd ≈ 2π × 1.52 kHz.
We choose δ ≈ 2π × 27.1 kHz while maintaining a Raman detuning of approximately 480 GHz
red detuned from the 2P1/2 state. We simultaneously apply microwaves and laser beams for a

variable duration t, followed by detection pulses. We observe coherent Rabi ﬂopping between

5

the |↑↑(cid:105) and |T(cid:105) states as shown in Fig. 2, where the population in the |↑↑(cid:105) and |↓↓(cid:105) states, and
the ﬁdelity of the |T(cid:105) state are determined as described in the supplementary material.

Figure 2: Two-ion population evolution and |T(cid:105) state ﬁdelity for restricted dynamics with mi-
crowave and sideband excitations applied simultaneously. Population mainly evolves between
the |↑↑(cid:105) and the |T(cid:105) state, while other states have very small populations. The black dashed line
shows unit population/ﬁdelity. The pink diamonds, blue triangles, red squares and green circles
represent the measured populations of states with no spins up P0, one spin up P1, two spins
up P2, and the ﬁdelity of the |T(cid:105) state F|T(cid:105), respectively. The population measurements are
obtained by repeating the experiment 1,500 times; the ﬁdelity points are derived from 60,000
experiments [30]. The difference between P1 and F|T(cid:105) is due to the population in the |S(cid:105) state.
The solid lines show the results of a numerical simulation taking into account all known ex-
perimental imperfections, with the same coloring convention as for the measured populations.
We run the simulation with and without including an upper bound on the imperfections of cool-
ing and spin state initialization. The results of these two simulations are indistinguishable on
the scale shown in the ﬁgure. The populations and ﬁdelity are inferred by means of a maxi-
mum likelihood analysis and the error bars represent the uncertainties according to parametric
bootstrap resampling [30]. The uncertainties of F|T(cid:105) are smaller than the symbols.

We observe a maximal ﬁdelity of the |T(cid:105) state of 0.981+2−4 after a duration of tπ ≈ 116 µs,
2Ωd). The ﬁdelities and error

which matches the theoretical prediction [30] of tπ = π/(2

estimated to be 0.010 from insufﬁcient isolation of the subspace (Ωs/Ωd ≈ 12), 0.008 from
spontaneous emission [33], less than 0.006 from imperfect ground state cooling, and less than
0.002 from imperfect initialization of the |↑↑(cid:105) spin state [30]. We compare our data to a numer-
ical simulation including these errors (solid lines in Fig. 2) and ﬁnd good agreement.

The evolution is ideally unitary; therefore neglecting spontaneous emission and heating of

the motional normal mode, any state amplitudes outside the desired subspace can be recovered.

To demonstrate this, we apply a speciﬁcally tailored composite pulse pair which enables us
to return the population in the undesired states |↓↓, n = 0(cid:105), |S, n = 1(cid:105), and |↑↑, n = 2(cid:105) into
the isolated subspace and thereby increase the population of |T(cid:105). To do this we split the laser
pulse into two segments of duration t1 and t2, changing the laser phase by π and the sideband
detuning from δ1 to δ2 = −δ1. States outside the desired subspace are driven nonresonantly
from the |T(cid:105) state. The amplitudes of these undesired states get a contribution from each of
the two pulse segments, leading to an interference between the two contributions, reminiscent

of the two-pulse interference in Ramsey spectroscopy. Within ﬁrst order perturbation theory

one can show that the amplitudes of all undesired states interfere destructively and vanish at the

time where the ﬁdelity of |T(cid:105) is maximal if one sets δ1 = −δ2 =(cid:112)7/3Ωs, Ωd = Ωs/(3

√
6),

and t2 = 2t1. When the amplitudes of the undesired states vanish, the associated constructive
interference is in the amplitude of the |T(cid:105) state which will have a near unity population only
limited by higher order effects [30]. Experimentally we set Ωs = 2π×17.3 kHz, Ωd = 2π×2.55
kHz, δ1 = −δ2 = 2π × 26.8 kHz, t1 = 25.4 µs, and t2 = 47.3 µs to obtain a |T(cid:105) state population
of 0.990+2−5. The symbols in Fig. 3 show the experimentally observed population evolution
during the composite pulse sequence, in agreement with numerical simulations (solid lines).
Higher ﬁdelity is achieved despite a smaller ratio Ωs/Ωd ≈ 7, by recovering amplitudes that
leaked out due to insufﬁcient isolation of the subspace, reducing this error to 0.001 (We note

7

that according to simulations, further reduction can be achieved with better calibration of t1).

The reduced Ωs/Ωd has the beneﬁcial effect of suppressing the spontaneous emission error to

0.005. Similar to the single-pulse experiment, we estimate errors less than 0.005 from imperfect
ground state cooling, and less than 0.002 from imperfect initialization of the |↑↑(cid:105) spin state [30].
We compare our data to a numerical simulation including these errors (solid lines in Fig. 3) and

ﬁnd good agreement.

Figure 3: State evolution for restricted dynamics of two trapped ions using a composite pulse
sequence. Similar to Fig. 2, populations are mainly conﬁned to the |↑↑(cid:105) and |T(cid:105) states. The
coloring and labeling conventions are the same as in Fig. 2. The laser beam phase and detuning
are ﬂipped 25.4 µs after the start of the experiment. Note that the oscillations of |↓↓(cid:105) are en-
hanced for t > 25.4 µs; however the maximal population of the |T(cid:105) state is increased compared
to the single pulse used for the data in Fig. 2. We numerically simulate this experiment with
and without including an upper bound of imperfections of cooling and spin state initialization.
The simulation results overlap on the scale of the ﬁgure. The populations, ﬁdelity and error
bars are inferred as in Fig. 2 [30]. The population measurements are obtained by repeating
the experiment 1,000 times; the ﬁdelity points are derived from 40,000 experiments [30]. The
uncertainties of F|T(cid:105) are smaller than the symbols.

We also demonstrate restricted dynamics on three 9Be+ ions. We tune the laser beam fre-

quencies to address the center-of-mass (COM) mode blue sideband, which has equal mode

8

duration t / 7s020406080100populations and fidelity00.20.40.60.81P0P1P2F|Tiamplitudes on each ion. The ion spacings are set such that the phase of the sideband interaction
on each ion differs by 2π/3 so that the |W, n = 0(cid:105) state will be a dark state of the sideband
interaction [30]. Starting from the |↑↑↑, n = 0(cid:105) state, and with driving ﬁeld parameters similar
to the case of two ions, we observe ﬂopping between the |↑↑↑(cid:105) and |W(cid:105) states, in agreement
with the numerical simulations [30]. We obtain a |W(cid:105) state ﬁdelity of 0.910+4−7 after a duration
of 114.1 µs. The sources of inﬁdelity include those of the two-ion case (in general leading to

larger imperfections) plus two sizable additions: 0.011 from heating of the COM mode caused

by electric ﬁeld noise and 0.023 from unequal laser illumination on the three ions due to the

Gaussian proﬁle of the laser beam [30].

For more than three ions in a chain, numerical simulations and analytic analysis indicate the

presence of unwanted dark states such that straightforward application of the sideband interac-

tion does not yield an effective two-level system between the ﬁrst two Dicke states. However,

by using a combination of sideband laser interactions on multiple motional modes and engi-

neering the relative phases of the sideband couplings on each ion, the scheme may be scaled up

to isolate an effective two-level system of multiple spins [34].

In summary, we describe and demonstrate a scheme to isolate subspaces of spin states with

trapped ions, enabling the creation of entangled states by the application of global uniform

oscillating ﬁelds. We create a two-ion triplet Bell state with ﬁdelity of 0.990+2−5, and a three-
ion |W(cid:105) state with ﬁdelity of 0.910+4−7. The entangled state ﬁdelity is relatively insensitive to
ﬂuctuations in laser power and frequency and motional mode frequency ﬂuctuations, since the

main requirement is that the frequency shifts due to the laser-induced spin-motion coupling are

large compared to the microwave Rabi frequency, but the exact value and stability of the shifts

are not crucial. Therefore, this scheme may serve as an alternative way of preparing entangled

states, without using conventional multi-qubit entangling quantum logic gates [35]. This work

also presents an application of Hilbert space engineering, which may be extended to generate

9

other entangled states or spin dynamics. Our scheme can be generalized to other experimental

platforms, for example superconducting qubits or atoms in a cavity.

1 Motional modes for two and three ion chains

For two ions, the axial modes of motion are the center-of-mass “COM” mode and the stretch
mode. In our experiment, these frequencies were approximately 2π × {3.58, 6.20} MHz. The
COM and stretch normal mode amplitudes for the two ions are {{ 1√

tively (the two ions oscillate in phase and out-of-phase for these motional modes respectively).

We alternately apply red sideband and re-pumping pulses 30 times each to cool the COM and

stretch modes to reach motional states that are very close to the asymptotic equilibrium motional

occupation [31]; the COM and stretch mode mean phonon occupation numbers are determined
to be smaller than {0.01, 0.006}, respectively.

For three 9Be+ ions in a linear chain, the three axial modes are the COM, stretch, and
“Egyptian” with frequencies approximately 2π × {3.60, 6.24, 8.68} MHz, and mode ampli-

2 Sideband and microwave interactions

To induce the sideband interaction, we apply a pair of laser beams such that the difference

of their momentum vectors ∆k at the site of the ions is aligned along the trap axis and their

frequency difference is set to ω0 + ω + δ, detuned from the blue sideband of a normal mode
of frequency ω (the stretch mode for two and the COM mode for three ions) by δ (cid:28) {ω0, ω}.
For two ions, taking the equilibrium position of ion 1 to be the origin of the axis, we denote the

equilibrium position of ion 2 to be X (here X is a number, not an operator). The lasers induce a

near-resonant “blue sideband” coupling on the stretch mode described in the interaction frame

11

by [36]

Hs = Ωs(σ−

1 − ei|∆k|Xσ−

2 )ae−iδt+iφ + H.c.,

(S1)

where the ei|∆k|X term represents the differential optical laser phase between the two ions. The
minus sign between the σ operators results from the opposite motional mode amplitudes of the

ions in the stretch mode. The phase difference of the Raman laser beams at the origin for t = 0

is denoted as φ. To obtain the coupling of Eq. (2), we adjust the axial conﬁnement such that

the ion-spacing X is as close as possible to M 2π|∆k|, with M being an integer number; in our
experiment M = 18. This gives Hs the form quoted in the main text and leads to the desired

couplings isolating the subspace, as discussed there and in Sec. 4 below.

For three ions, we apply laser beams tuned close to the blue sideband of the COM mode so

that the ions have identical motional amplitudes. We take the center ion equilibrium position to
be zero, and the outer ions’ equilibrium positions are ±X(cid:48). Thus the sideband interaction can
be expressed as

be as close as possible to M(cid:48) 2π|∆k|, in our experiment M(cid:48) = 46

where |W(cid:105) and |W(cid:105) are deﬁned in the text. Such a global rotation alone can not gener-
ate entanglement. However, the sideband excitations perturb the |W(cid:105) state, coupling it to
|Wc(cid:105) = ei2π/3|↑↑↓(cid:105)+|↑↓↑(cid:105)+e−i2π/3|↓↑↑(cid:105)
and shifting it out of resonance with respect to the weak
microwave drive as shown on the right. Thus the microwave drive couples to only the two high-
est energy states in the symmetric manifold, and the entangled |W(cid:105) states can be created with
an effective π pulse driving from the |↑↑↑(cid:105) state.

of the |W , n = 0(cid:105) state out of resonance, by its coupling to |Wc, n = 1(cid:105), leading to the desired
subspace restrictions. As opposed to the two-ion case, the isolated subspace can be achieved
s as a resonant interaction with detuning δ(cid:48) = 0, since the |W , n = 0(cid:105) state only couples
with H(cid:48)
to |Wc(cid:105)|n = 1(cid:105). Thus with Ω(cid:48)
d, and the axial modes in the ground state, the weak
microwave drive only couples the initial state to the |W(cid:105) state, while further coupling to the
|W(cid:105) state is off resonance. Similar to the two-ion case described in Sec. 4.2, we can thus
create the |W(cid:105) state with a single microwave effective π-pulse where the effective π-time is

We measure spin populations by transferring the states |↑(cid:105) and |↓(cid:105) to other hyperﬁne states
that are maximally distinguishable with laser-induced resonance ﬂuorescence. We transfer pop-
ulation from the |↑(cid:105) state to the |F = 2, mF = 2(cid:105) state using a composite microwave π pulse.

The pulse sequence is { π
and the azimuthal angle of a vector in the x-y plane of the Bloch sphere about which the spin
is rotated. We then use a microwave π pulse to transfer population from the |↓(cid:105) states to the
|F = 1, mF = −1(cid:105), and another microwave π pulse to transfer any residual |↓(cid:105) state population
to the |F = 1, mF = 0(cid:105) state. We ﬁnally apply a σ+ laser beam resonant with the cycling
transition between the 2S1/2|F = 2, mF = 2(cid:105) and 2P3/2|F = 3, mF = 3(cid:105) states and record ion
ﬂuorescence counts for 330 µs on a photo-multiplier tube. For the two (three) ion experiments,
we count approximately 39 (37) photons for each ion transferred to the |2, 2(cid:105) state, and 3 pho-
tons for each ion transferred to the |1,−1(cid:105) or |1, 0(cid:105) states, with negligible constant stray light
and dark count background.

A straightforward method to extract populations would be to approximate the histograms by

14

sums of Poissonian distributions. However, imperfect polarization and off-resonant transitions

in the detection process, such as optical pumping, give rise to deviations from simple Poissoni-

ans that could lead to erroneously inferred populations. Pumping effects can be accounted for, if

the histograms are analyzed with the maximum likelihood (ML) partial tomography algorithm

outlined below. For two-ion experiments, it implicitly infers the probabilities of zero, one and
two ions in the |F = 2, mF = 2(cid:105) state, denoted as Pi, i = {0, 1, 2}, respectively. Neglecting
mapping errors, these probabilities can be assigned to zero to two ions in the |↑(cid:105) state.

To obtain the |T(cid:105) state ﬁdelity, we repeat the experiment and insert a microwave {π/2, Φ}
“analysis” pulse with variable phase Φ before the state transfer pulses and collection of ﬂuores-
cence counts histograms. This pulse rotates the |T(cid:105) state into superpositions of |↑↑(cid:105) and |↓↓(cid:105)
states, while the |S(cid:105) state is invariant. All collected histograms, with and without the analysis
pulse, and additional reference histograms, which we assume to detect known populations (see
below), form the input to the ML algorithms to infer the ﬁdelity of the |T(cid:105) state, denoted as
F|T(cid:105).

For three ions, the detection process is similar to two ions, except the rotation angle of
the analysis pulse is Θ = arccos(1/3). Such an operation rotates |W(cid:105) to a superposition of
the |↑↑↑(cid:105), |W(cid:105) and |↓↓↓(cid:105) states, while the rotation on |Wc(cid:105) and |Wac(cid:105) states retains 2/3 of
their populations in the P2 population. Thus we distinguish the |W(cid:105) state from the |Wc(cid:105) and
|Wac(cid:105) states. Provided with these data and the reference histograms, the ML partial tomography
algorithm can unambiguously deduce the probabilities that zero to three ions are in the |↑(cid:105) state,
denoted as Pi, i = {0, 1, 2, 3}, respectively and FW , the ﬁdelity of the |W(cid:105) state. The evolution
of the observed populations is shown in Fig. S2.

For the two-ion single-pulse and composite-pulse experiments respectively, we determine
the |T(cid:105) state ﬁdelities from histograms obtained with 30,000 and 20,000 separate measurements
respectively; when applying the analysis pulses to the |T(cid:105) state, we determine the populations

Solid lines are the result of the numerical simulation, with and without the imperfection of spin
state initialization. The simulation results are overlapping on the scale shown in the ﬁgure. The
population measurements are obtained by repeating the experiment 1,000 times, and for the
ﬁdelity measurements we take additional data, as described in the text. The uncertainties of
F|T(cid:105) are smaller than the labels.

For the ML partial tomography algorithm, we record histograms of an unknown state to be

determined as well as states for which we assume the populations are known. The former are

called data histograms, the latter reference histograms. To measure spins along different axes of

the Bloch sphere, the unknown state can be modiﬁed by a known unitary rotation - an analysis

pulse - before recording a data histogram as described above. The reference histograms are

16

duration t / 7s050100150populations and fidelity00.20.40.60.81P3P2P1P0F|Wiused to derive count distributions for n ions in the bright state, where n is an integer. These

are then used to extract spin populations from the data histograms. For the two-ion experiment,

n is 0, 1, or 2; for the three-ion experiment, n ranges from 0 to 3. To obtain the reference
histograms, we ﬁrst optically pump the ions to the |2, 2(cid:105) state. We then drive transitions be-
tween the |2, 2(cid:105) state and the |1, 1(cid:105) state by applying a pulse sequence {3π/2, 0}-{π/2, Φ} with
Φ sampled from N π/4, N = 0 − 7. The reference histograms are obtained by subsequent
ﬂuorescence detection of the laser-induced cycling transition |2, 2(cid:105) ↔ 2p 2P3/2|3, 3(cid:105) followed
by transferring the |1, 1(cid:105) state to the |1,−1(cid:105) and |1, 0(cid:105) states via the |2, 0(cid:105) state. We repeat the
process 6,000 times for each value of Φ to accumulate photon-counts for reference histograms.

For these initial reference histograms, we restrict ourselves to separable states where we can

assume that the state preparation and rotations are of much higher ﬁdelity than the operations

to produce entangled states. This assumption was independently veriﬁed in separate calibration

experiments. For efﬁciency, we bin several channels of the original histograms together to re-

duce the number of parameters that need to be inferred. This strategy takes advantage of the fact

that the histograms have much more information than is necessary for inferring the parameters

of interest with sufﬁciently low uncertainty. We bin contiguous ranges of ﬂuorescence counts

by means of a heuristic that minimizes loss of information while trying to introduce as few bin

boundaries as possible. A simple example of this binning strategy with actual experimental

reference histograms is depicted in Fig. S3, where we use three bins. For the analysis of actual

experimental histograms, we choose ﬁve bins for the two-ion experiment and seven bins for the

three-ion experiment. We use 10 % of each of the reference histograms exclusively to determine

the bin boundaries which are then ﬁxed for analyzing the remainder of the reference data and

the histograms of the entangled states. The bin boundaries also remain ﬁxed when extracting

the uncertainty estimates.

We can, in principle, use a maximum likelihood method to ﬁnd the binned count distri-

and microwave rotations, which we assume to be perfect. Subsequently, the inferred count
distributions can be used to extract populations in the |↑(cid:105) state for each data histogram. We
assume that the reference histograms are consistent with the data and compute likelihoods with

a probabilistic model, which simultaneously assigns the probability of observing counts in both

the reference histograms and the data histograms of the unknown state. Here, we summarize

the method, which will be detailed in a future publication. On one hand, we assign reference

probability distributions (Fig. S3(c)) and compare to each of the references (Fig. S3(b)); on

the other hand, under the assumption that the initial state preparation and the analysis pulses

are perfect, we can assign a density matrix for the experiment output state and use the refer-

ence probability distributions to compare with the data histograms. The joined results of the

above two processes lead to an overall likelihood. We then alternate between maximizing the

likelihood by varying reference count probabilities with the assigned density matrix ﬁxed and

maximizing it by varying the assigned density matrix with the reference count probabilities

ﬁxed. The inferred reference count probabilities can be improved by standard techniques for

convex optimization over a polytope. For the density matrix, we use the “RρR” algorithm that

keeps the estimated density matrix physical while increasing the likelihood at each iteration

[37]. Because we do not use an informationally complete set of measurements, the likelihood

is maximized equally by any of a set of density matrices that are indistinguishable by our mea-

surements. One of these density matrices, ρML, is identiﬁed by the ML algorithm. However,

because the measurements are sufﬁcient to estimate the experimental states’ ﬁdelity with re-
spect to the desired target state |ψ(cid:105), all possible maximum likelihood density matrices yield the
same ﬁdelity Fψ = T r(|ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ|ρML). This is ensured by the design of the unitary rotations to
analyze the states: After applying a rotation Ui, we perform ﬂuorescence detection and collect
count histograms that correspond to measurements of n ions in the |↑(cid:105) state as T r(AnUiρU

†
i ),

19

where for example An=0,1,2 = {|↓↓(cid:105)(cid:104)↓↓|,|↑↓(cid:105)(cid:104)↑↓| + |↓↑(cid:105)(cid:104)↓↑|,|↑↑(cid:105)(cid:104)↑↑|}, respectively. The Ui’s
are designed for ﬁdelity measurement of target state |ψ(cid:105) such that there exists a linear combi-
i ) that is equal to the projector onto the target state |ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ|, which yields
†
nation of T r(AnUiρU
the overlap, or ﬁdelity, of the experimental density matrix with the targeted state |ψ(cid:105), but not
sufﬁcient for the entire density matrix. Thus, the tomography is partial in the sense that not all

features of the unknown state are inferable, but the relevant populations and ﬁdelities are.

The uncertainty of inferred quantities such as the ﬁdelities of interest are obtained by para-

metric bootstrap resampling with 500 resamples [38], which determines the 68 % uncertainty

intervals for the ﬁdelities. Since we found that the bootstrap distribution of the ﬁdelity es-

timate is approximately symmetric, we estimate a conservative 68 % conﬁdence interval for
ﬁdelity as (F − 0 − syst, F + 0), where 0 = (U − L)/2; U and L are the 0.16 and 0.84
quantiles of the bootstrap distribution respectively and syst is a systematic error term (see be-

low). We also computed the log-likelihood-ratios with respect to the empirical bin frequen-

cies for each of the 500 bootstrapped analyses, and determined the percentile of the originally

found log-likelihood-ratio in the resulting distribution. This constitutes a bootstrap likelihood-

ratio test for the model used by the analysis [39, 40]. The percentiles found are 22 % for the

two-ion single pulse experiment, 18 % for the two-ion composite pulse experiment, and 8 %

for the three-ion experiment. These percentiles can be interpreted as bootstrap p-value esti-

mates. We also investigate the sensitivity of the inferred entangled state ﬁdelity due to the
imperfect initial |↑(cid:105) state preparation. We redo the data analysis assuming the initial density
matrices for the reference histograms are (1 − )2ρ↑↑ + (1 − )(ρ↑↓ + ρ↓↑) + 2ρ↓↓ for two
ions and (1 − )3ρ↑↑↑ + (1 − )2(ρ↑↑↓ + ρ↑↓↑ + ρ↓↑↑) + 2(1 − )(ρ↓↓↑ + ρ↓↑↓ + ρ↑↓↓) + 3ρ↓↓↓
for three ions, where  is the incoherent inﬁdelity per ion. We ﬁnd that for  in a range of

[0, 0.002], the inferred inﬁdelities are approximately given by c, where c is a coefﬁcient. We
have  (cid:54) max = 0.001 from separate experiments [41]. Thus we obtain an upper bound for

20

a systematic error syst = cmax, where the values of c are 0.0021 for the two-ion single pulse

experiment, 0.0026 for the two-ion composite pulse experiment, and 0.0025 for the three-ion

experiment. Thus we report a conservative 68 % uncertainty interval for ﬁdelity as F +0−(syst+0).

4 Model for the state evolution with two ions

For two ions we use a speciﬁcally tailored composite pulse sequence. Below we present a theo-

retical analysis of the two-ion scheme with and without applying the composite pulse sequence.

the microwave drive Hd(t),

The Rabi-frequencies Ωs, Ωd and the detuning δ can be varied in order to maximize the |T(cid:105) state
ﬁdelity. In the experiment, we turn on/off the laser beams implementing Hs approximately 0.4

µs, before/after the microwave ﬁeld implementing Hs. In the models discussed here, we only

describe the periods when the laser beams and microwave ﬁeld are acting simultaneously.

In the single-pulse experiment, the time dependence of Ωd(t) is given by

We assume the system is initialized in the state |↑↑(cid:105) (the ions are assumed to be in the
motional ground state unless speciﬁed otherwise). From this initial state we desire to prepare
the triplet state |T(cid:105) by a single pulse, using the drives Hd and Hs simultaneously. Rewriting Hd
in terms of the states |↑↑(cid:105), |T(cid:105), and |↓↓(cid:105) yields

√

Hd(t) =

2 Ωd(t) (|T(cid:105)(cid:104)↑↑| + |↓↓(cid:105)(cid:104)T|) + H.c.,

(S11)

which shows that Hd resonantly drives |↑↑(cid:105) to |T(cid:105) and further on to |↓↓(cid:105).
If the coupling
between |T(cid:105) and |↓↓(cid:105) is turned off, a single pulse of duration tπ = π
would prepare |T(cid:105)
√

from |↑↑(cid:105) with unit ﬁdelity. To suppress the coupling to |↓↓(cid:105), we use the sideband coupling Hs.
The subspace Sd spanned by |↑↑, 0(cid:105) and |T, 0(cid:105) does not couple to the sideband Hamiltonian Hs,
however, |↓↓, 0(cid:105) is coupled to |S, 1(cid:105) and that state is in turn coupled to |↑↑, 2(cid:105) by Hs. These
three states form a subspace which we shall refer to as the undesired subspace Su. As we shall

2Ωd

see, the sideband coupling Hs can be engineered to suppress the microwave coupling to the
undesired states |↓↓, 0(cid:105), |S, 1(cid:105), and |↑↑, 2(cid:105), as discussed in Sec. 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5. In addition,
it is possible to recover population that still leaks to the undesired subspace by the composite

pulse technique discussed in Sec. 4.6.

as a function of the detuning δ. Values of δ for which there are two eigenfrequencies of the
same absolute value are marked by red arrows. It can be seen that for δ = 0 a dark state with
3Ωs, two of the three eigenfrequencies have the same magnitude
and opposite signs, ∆1 = −∆2, which allows for a commensurate evolution of the dressed
states. The third eigenfrequency is |∆3| ≈ 3.97|∆1/2| so that we ﬁnd a close-to harmonic ratio
∆1 : ∆2 : ∆3 ∼ 1 : −1 : 4.

4.3 Engineering the undesired subspace

We transform the Hamiltonian into a frame rotating with the sideband detuning using a unitary
U(t) = exp

(with δ(t) as given in Eq. (S10)). In this frame we have

(S12)

(S14)

and Hd as given by Eq. (S7) or (S11) remains unchanged. Assuming that the motion is initially
in the ground state, we can restrict the discussion of the undesired states to |↓↓, 0(cid:105) and the two
states coupled to it by the sideband interaction, |S, 1(cid:105) and |↑↑, 2(cid:105). The couplings of these states
are

(S16)

It is possible to diagonalize Hu = Hδ,u + Hs,u and thereby ﬁnd three dressed states |ψi(cid:105), i =
1, 2, 3, of Hu. However, the expressions for the eigenfrequencies and eigenstates in terms of

Ωs and δ are quite involved so that it is difﬁcult to extract conclusions from the expressions.
It is therefore helpful to investigate the eigenfrequencies graphically as shown in Fig. S4. As

will become evident below, it is particularly advantageous to have a harmonic ratio between the

eigenfrequencies. We focus on three special cases which are marked with red arrows in Fig.

S4. For no detuning, δ = 0, we ﬁnd two eigenfrequencies ∆1/2 = ±√

6Ωs which have the

same magnitude but opposite signs, and a zero eigenfrequency, ∆0 = 0, which corresponds

to a dark state of Hu. The zero eigenfrequency makes this parameter choice unattractive, as
the dark state would be resonantly coupled to |T(cid:105). Instead we focus on two other values of δ,
where the absolute values of two eigenfrequencies are equal. Since the third eigenfrequency is
also nonzero, the microwave couplings from |T(cid:105) to all three dressed states are nonresonant, and
therefore they are only weakly excited. This situation arises at the detuning

As we discuss below, when weakly driven the populations of the dressed states will oscillate at
their eigenfrequencies. Due to the harmonic ratio |∆1| : |∆2| = 1 : 1 the oscillations of the
amplitude on |ψ1(cid:105) and |ψ2(cid:105) in time will remain synchronized to each other. Quite remarkably,

24

also the ratio of the ﬁrst two eigenfrequencies and the third eigenfrequency is nearly harmonic,
|∆3| ≈ 3.97|∆1,2|. The amplitude of |ψ3(cid:105) thus shares points of nearly the same phase (such
as common extrema) with the amplitudes of |ψ1/2(cid:105) at times which are multiples of 2π/|∆1/2|,
provided that the considered time interval is no too long. As we will show in Sec. 4.6 we

can use these close-to harmonic ratios to ensure that we can ﬁnd suitable parameters where the

amplitudes of all dressed states nearly vanish simultaneously for the composite pulse. Other
points where the eigenfrequencies are harmonics of each other, e.g. |∆1| = 2|∆2|, exist but are
not considered here.

In Sec. 4.4, Sec. 4.5 and Sec. 4.6 we will investigate leakage between the subspaces Sd

and Su by means of perturbation theory. To this end, we transform the full Hamiltonian to the

dressed state picture using δopt,+ from Eq. (S17) and the dressed states,

The coupling from |T(cid:105) to states other than |↑↑(cid:105) is detuned from resonance and can be suppressed
by an arbitrary amount if we assume a sufﬁciently small ratio |Ωd/Ωs| (cid:28) 1. In practice, spon-
taneous emission and other decoherence mechanisms limit how small we can make this ratio,

and we need to determine the resulting leakage to the dressed states. We do this by perturbation

theory in Sec. 4.4. Secondly, the energies of the dressed states depend only on Ωs and δ. The

sign of the eigenfrequencies ∆n can therefore be reversed by reversing the signs of Ωs and δ

simultaneously, while the eigenvectors remain unchanged, a relation that is exploited for the

analysis of the composite dynamics in Sec. 4.6, where it is used to ensure destructive interfer-
ence of the amplitudes on undesired states. We note that while the change δ → −δ may have
some resemblance to spin echo [42], the mechanism that we use is completely different.

4.4 Dynamics of the microwave excitation
4.4.1 Description in perturbation theory

For sufﬁciently large energy shifts ∆n of the dressed states and/or weak enough drive Ωd

we can use perturbation theory to assess the dynamics of the system. To this end, H0 in Eqs.
(S23)-(S26) is the unperturbed Hamiltonian containing the coupling between |↑↑(cid:105) and |T(cid:105) in
the subspace Sd as well as the undesired states in Su in the dressed state basis. Under H0, the

subspaces Sd and Su are uncoupled. The Hamiltonian H1 includes all the couplings between Sd

26

and Su and will be treated as a perturbation which contains the weak couplings (Ω1−3 ∼ Ωd).
To zeroth order in perturbation theory the initial state |ψ(0)(0)(cid:105) = |↑↑(cid:105) will evolve into

T (t)|T(cid:105),

|ψ(0)(t)(cid:105) = c(0)↑↑ (t)|↑↑(cid:105) + c(0)
c(0)↑↑ (t) = cos (Ω0t) ,
T (t) = −i sin (Ω0t) .

A pulse of a duration tπ = π

will thus evolve the initial state to |T(cid:105). For the excitation of the

undesired states we make the ansatz

|ψ(1)(t)(cid:105) =

n (t)|ψn(cid:105).

The dynamics of the coefﬁcients of the dressed states is then described by

The coefﬁcient in Eq. (S37) is seen to contain exactly the same fraction Ωn/∆n. The term in
Eq. (S37) thus represents the adiabatic dressing of |T(cid:105), whereas the remaining terms in Eq.
(S36) are diabatic contributions from applying the pulse with a non-vanishing Ω0.

The population of the dressed state n is given by

n (t) = |c(1)

4.4.2 State-amplitude evolution

Before going into details with the optimization, it is instructive to investigate the evolution of

the coefﬁcients graphically. In Fig. S5 we parametrically plot the trajectories of the coefﬁcients

c(1)
n (t) in the complex plane for different cases. In a) we ﬁrst show the evolution assuming time-

independent c(0)
they return at multiples of tn = 2π/|∆n|, where e−i∆nt = 1. For time-independent c(0)

For c(0)
T = 1 we ﬁnd a cyclic evolution which returns to zero at multiples of tn = 2π|∆n|. (b) For
T (t) = −i sin(Ω0t) we ﬁnd that returning to the origin is only possible around the time where

dressed state trajectories. In (a) and (b) we use Ωd = 2Ωs/(5
(S41). (c) Using a composite pulse technique (described in Sec. 4.6) which reverses the sign
of ∆n at an intermediate time t1 = tπ/3 (marked by thin red arrows), it is possible to redirect
√
the trajectories of the dressed states such that the amplitudes vanish at t = tπ (here shown for
6)). For the third dressed state |ψ3(cid:105) the amplitude nearly

too large time intervals it would thus always be possible have a very small population in all |ψn(cid:105)
at any integer multiple of tn due to the nearly harmonic ratio ∆1 : ∆2 : ∆3 ≈ 1 : −1 : 4.

Taking into account the time dependence of the triplet state coefﬁcient, the evolution in ﬁrst

order perturbation theory, as given by c(1)

n (t) in Eq. (S36) is plotted in b). The ﬁrst term in Eq.

(S36) moves the coefﬁcient along the imaginary axis. On top of this, the second term in Eq.

(S36) represents a combination of a displacement along the real axis and a circular motion. In
the limit Ωn (cid:28) ∆n we are dominated by the displacement along the imaginary axis which is
proportional to the triplet state amplitude (since it is mainly caused by the adiabatic dressing as

described by Eq. (S38)). We can thus not ﬁnd a situation where the amplitude on the dressed

4.5 Harmonic synchronization

In the previous section we found that with constant carrier and sideband driving ﬁelds we

cannot achieve perfect triplet ﬁdelity. As we will discuss in the following, we can still vary the

driving strength Ωd to maximize the triplet ﬁdelity by synchronizing the maximum of the triplet

population to occur when the dressed state amplitudes go through a local minimum.

From Eq. (S40) we see that the temporal evolution of the dressed states populations con-

sists of an envelope with a periodicity in Ω0 and a modulation with a periodicity in ∆n. This

periodicity gives rise to minimal and maximal values of the population Pn(t) with respect to

time. To synchronize a minimum of the oscillations of Pn(t) with the pulse duration, we take

sin(∆ntπ) = 1. For n = 1 this yields the optimal drive strengths

Ωd,opt,m =

|∆1|
√
2(4m + 1)

,

for m = 0, 1, 2, . . .

(S41)

We can now take advantage of the fact that |∆1| = |∆2| as found for δ = δopt,± in Sec. 4.3. This
relation means that we can minimize the population of both |ψ1(cid:105) and |ψ2(cid:105) simultaneously by the
choice in Eq. (S41). In Fig. 7(b) we have used parameters corresponding to m = 1 and mark

the position of the local minimum by the blue arrow. As ∆3 is much bigger, the population of
|ψ3(cid:105) is more than an order of magnitude lower and thus less important. Inserting Ωd,opt,m into
Eq. (S36), we obtain for the coefﬁcients of the dressed states

In the last step we have assumed ∆3 ≈ 4∆1 to simplify the expressions. We estimate the
inﬁdelity of the protocol by the populations of the undesired states to lowest order. Since the
population of |ψ3(cid:105) is much smaller than that of |ψ1−2(cid:105), we can approximate the error of the
protocol by only including the ﬁrst two terms,

For the three lowest choices of m we obtain the ﬁdelities

Fopt,0 ≈ 0.75 (for m = 0)
Fopt,1 ≈ 0.97 (for m = 1)
Fopt,2 ≈ 0.99 (for m = 2)

In the experiment, we have chosen to operate at m = 2. Here we ﬁnd the optimal driving

strength Ωd,opt,2 = 2Ωs/(9

√
6) ≈ Ωs/11.

In Fig. S6 a)-c) we plot the simulated temporal evolution for m = 2. Here, as a result of the

synchronization, the fast oscillations of the dressed states are symmetric around the maximum

of F|T(cid:105). The maximum of the triplet population coincides with a local minimum of the undesired

states, as can be seen in the bare (b) and the dressed (c) state pictures of the undesired subspace.

In the absence of decoherence, higher ﬁdelities can be achieved for higher m, i.e. for more

oscillations within the driving pulse. This is shown in Fig. S7 a), where we plot the ﬁdelity

resulting from simulating the Hamiltonian in Eq. (S12) as a function of Ωs/Ωd with a ﬁxed

sideband driving Ωs and detuning δ. It can be seen that the optimization by synchronizing the

oscillations of the dressed states with the oscillations of F|T(cid:105) allows us to signiﬁcantly decrease

the error.

Performing numerical simulations for the experimental parameters Ωs/Ωd ≈ 12, which are
close to the derived optimum of Ωs/Ωd ≈ 11 for m = 2, we observe a reduction in the maxi-
mal value of the |T(cid:105) state population of 0.0096 due to population of states outside the desired

31

Fig. S6: Minimization of the population of the undesired states by harmonic synchronization
(a)-(c) and composite pulse (d)-(f). (a)-(c) The ﬁgures show the result of a numerical simulation
of the full Schr¨odinger equation. Adjusting Ωd allows for a minimization of the population in
the undesired subspace when F|T(cid:105) (green solid line in (a)) is maximized (denoted by thick blue
arrows in (b) and (c)). At this point, a half oscillation of F|T(cid:105) contains an integer number of os-
cillations of the undesired states (b), or of the dressed states resulting from a diagonalization of
the undesired subspace (c). The synchronization is possible for the dressed states |ψ1(cid:105) and |ψ2(cid:105)
simultaneously because of the harmonic ratio of their eigenfrequencies, whereas the population
of |ψ3(cid:105) is considerably smaller. This allows for a ﬁdelity of F|T(cid:105) ≈ 0.99 for the experimental
parameters (m = 2, Ωd/Ωs ≈ 11) when neglecting other imperfections. Higher ﬁdelities are
achieved with a composite pulse technique (d)-(f) where the signs of Ωs and δ are reversed at a
time t1 (denoted by black dashed lines). This makes the minima of the error much smaller, as
can be seen from the populations of the undesired states |↓↓(cid:105), |S, 1(cid:105), and |↑↑, 2(cid:105) in (e) or their
dressed states in (f), and can be understood from the trajectories in Fig. S5 (c). In this way,

subspace in agreement with the result in Eq. (S47). Together with inﬁdelities due to other ex-

perimental imperfections which we assess below, this imperfection contributes signiﬁcantly to
the experimentally observed inﬁdelity of the single-pulse scheme of ∼ 0.02. This inﬁdelity can
be reduced by making the ratio Ωs/Ωd larger, which requires reducing the Rabi frequency of the

mediate time t1. (a) For the single-pulse, the ﬁdelity of the triplet (blue solid line – without
decoherence, red dashed line – with decoherence) exhibits a periodic behavior as a function of
the ratio of the strengths of the sideband and the drive, Ωs/Ωd. The maxima are obtained from
the harmonic synchronizing condition discussed in Sec. 4.5. The ﬁrst maximum in the ﬁgure
(m = 1) is found at Ωs/Ωd ≈ 6 and the second (m = 2) at Ωs/Ωd ≈ 11. In the absence of
decoherence, a weaker microwave drive Ωd results in a better performance. Larger values of
|Ωs| increase the inﬁdelity due to spontaneous emission, leading to an optimal drive strength,
where both effects are balanced. (b)-(c) For the composite pulse (0 < t1 < tπ), the inﬁdelity
(plotted logarithmically) exhibits oscillatory behavior with respect to Ωs/Ωd, and an optimum
intermediate time is found at t1,opt = tπ/3, in agreement with the analytical results in Sec. 4.6.
This behavior is found both in the absence (b) and in the presence (c) of spontaneous emission.
Without spontaneous emission (b), the ﬁdelity increases from F|T(cid:105) ≈ 0.999 for the ﬁrst maxi-
mum (m = 1) at Ωs/Ωd ≈ 7 towards higher maxima with lower drive, e.g. F|T(cid:105) ≈ 0.9999 at the
second maximum (m = 2) with Ωs/Ωd ≈ 14, whereas with decoherence (c) the ﬁdelity is high-
est for the ﬁrst maximum, F|T(cid:105) ≈ 0.995, and decreases towards higher ones, e.g. F|T(cid:105) ≈ 0.991
for m = 2.

microwaves or increasing the laser power. However, this will lead to increased inﬁdelity due to

spontaneous emission, as is discussed in Sec. 5.1. Thus, for a given spontaneous emission rate,
a compromise emerges from the need to keep Ωd (cid:28) Ωs and the need to suppress decoherence.
In Fig. S7 a) we present a simulation including the noise sources discussed below. From this

simulation we ﬁnd that the optimum is around Ωs/Ωd = 12 for our conditions, which is the

value used in the experiment. In Fig. 2 in the main text, we plot the populations of the relevant

states as predicted by the numerical simulation and ﬁnd good agreement with the data.

4.6 Analysis of the composite pulse dynamics

In the preceding section we have shown how the ﬁdelity can be optimized by synchronizing

the oscillations of the dressed states to the envelope of the pulse. We will now show that the

attainable ﬁdelity can be further improved by using a composite pulse technique.

In Sec. 4.1, we discussed the possibility to reverse the sign of the sideband coupling,
Ωs → −Ωs, and the sideband detuning, δ → −δ at an intermediate time t1. This reverses
the Hamiltonian of the undesired subspace Hu and thus the energies of the dressed states,
∆n → −∆n, whereas the eigenstates and Ωn remain unchanged. This composite pulse se-
quence allows us to get a cancellation of the population of the dressed states to lowest order in

Ωd. Making the same ansatz as in Eq. (S32), the dynamics is described by

i ˙cn(t) = +∆ncn(t) + Ωn(t)cT (t),
i ˙cn(t) = −∆ncn(t) + Ωn(t)cT (t),

(t < t1)

Here the ﬁrst term which is proportional to the triplet amplitude c(0)

T (t) can again be understood
as the adiabatic dressing of the triplet state similar to Eq. (S37). The second term proportional

to the triplet amplitude c(0)
T (t1) at time t1 is a diabatic contribution resulting from the jump at t1.
Because the dressing of |T(cid:105) is proportional to Ωn/∆n (cf. Eq. (S38)), the change ∆n → −∆n
gives a diabatic contribution by exactly twice the dressing, resulting in the factor of two in Eq.

(S54).

As opposed to the situation in Sec. 4.5, it is now possible to achieve a cancellation c(1)

n (tπ) =

0 to ﬁrst order in Ωn/∆n. This condition is reached if the two terms of the sum interfere
destructively, which happens if ∆n(tπ−t1) = 2πm (for an integer number m) and 2 sin(Ω0t1) =
sin(Ω0tπ) = 1. Due to the factor of two in Eq. (S54) the switching thus has to take place at the

time when the triplet state amplitude is 1/2 which happens at

t1 =

tπ
3

.

(S55)

From the deﬁnition of tπ = π/(2Ω0), we also obtain a condition on the driving strength Ωd.

As in the previous section, due to the harmonic ratio of the dressed states ∆1 : ∆2 : ∆3 = 1 :
−1 :∼ 4, this condition can be fulﬁlled for dressed states |ψ1(cid:105) and |ψ2(cid:105) simultaneously, and also
approximately for |ψ3(cid:105). With the above conditions, we obtain the optimal driving strength:

The trajectories in the complex plane corresponding to m = 1 are shown in Fig. S5 c)

composite pulse is also evident in Fig. S6 d)-f) where we plot the simulated populations of the

system states as a function of time, obtained by simulating the Hamiltonian in Eq. (S12). The

populations of the undesired states at the point of maximal triplet population are smaller than in

the single-pulse scheme shown in Fig. S6 a)-c) and this leads to a signiﬁcant improvement of

35

the ﬁdelity. Both in Fig. S5 c) and in Fig. S6 d)-f), we use the fastest instance of the composite

protocol m = 1 where the optimal driving strength is

(S57)

which is close to the value of Ωd/Ωs ≈ 1/7 used in the experiment.

4.6.1 Second-order dynamics

Above we have seen that the excitation of the undesired subspace consisting of the basis states
|↓↓, 0(cid:105), |S, 1(cid:105) and |↑↑, 2(cid:105) or, equivalently, of the corresponding dressed states |ψ1(cid:105), |ψ2(cid:105), and
|ψ3(cid:105) can be canceled to ﬁrst order in Ωd/Ωs. We now consider effects to second order in Ωd/Ωs.

One contribution to second order comes from the terms we neglected when expanding Eq.
(S52) to lowest order in Eq. (S54). In addition, the resonant coupling of |↑↑, 2(cid:105) to |T, 2(cid:105) by
the microwave drive extends the coupled subspace so that the criteria for which we achieved

c(1)
1,2 = 0 are no longer exactly fulﬁlled. Describing this in full detail is beyond the scope of this
analysis. We therefore only estimate the order of magnitude of the error coming from the next

order in perturbation theory. As the amplitudes vanish to ﬁrst order in Ωd/Ωs, the remaining
amplitude on undesired components will scale as ∼ Ω2

This number is consistent with the result of a numerical optimization of the parameters, where

we perform simulation of the master equation (S59) using the Hamiltonian in (S12) with no

further imperfections. The result of this is shown in Fig. S7 b)-c). As can be seen from

Fig. S7 b), for decreasing values of Ωd, there are many points where the ﬁdelity is very high,
corresponding to different m in the above expressions. Numerically we ﬁnd an error of 1.2·10−3

36

when simulating the experimental parameters, m = 1 and Ωs/Ωd ≈ 7. [see also Fig. S6 c)-
f)]. Fine-tuning of the parameters in the numerical simulation in the vicinity of m = 1, and
setting t1 = 24.18 µs and t2 = 47.57 µs, allow for an even smaller error of only 4 · 10−4 in the
absence of additional imperfections, which is consistent with a fourth order contribution. The

experiment is, however, dominated by other sources of errors.

In the previous sections, we have seen that with the composite pulse technique it is possi-

ble to compensate for leakage to states outside of the desired subspace, the main inﬁdelity of

the entangled state generation. In the following, we provide analysis and discussion of other

processes which limit the ﬁdelity of the composite pulse protocol.

5.1 Spontaneous emission

Spontaneous emission through off-resonant excitation of electronically excited states induced
by the Raman sideband lasers causes decay from the desired subspace consisting of |↑↑(cid:105) and
|T(cid:105) to other states. We consider the master equation

which model decay processes from level |↑(cid:105) to |↓(cid:105) (Eq. (S60)) and |↓(cid:105) to |↑(cid:105) (Eq. (S61)) and
from |↑(cid:105) and |↓(cid:105) to a level |o(cid:105) outside the qubit manifold (Eqs. (S62) and (S63), respectively).
The subscripts i ∈ {1, 2} denote the ion which undergoes the decay. Here, we have modeled all
state outside the qubit space by a single level |o(cid:105).

The total decay rate out of |↑↑(cid:105) is Γ↑↑ = 2 (γ↓↑ + γo↑) and that from |T(cid:105) is ΓT = γ↑↓ +
γ↓↑ + γo↑ + γo↓. Since ΓT and Γ↑↑ are nearly equal to each other for our parameters, we make
the approximations that both |↑↑(cid:105) and |T(cid:105) decay with the mean decay rate ¯Γ = (ΓT + Γ↑↑)/2.
The reduction of ﬁdelity in |T(cid:105) due to spontaneous emission is then approximately P (1)
spe(t) ≈
1−e−¯Γt, and ¯Γ is estimated from separate experiments. At the time t = tπ, where the population
of |T(cid:105) is maximal, we obtain P (1)
spe(tπ) ≈ 8 · 10−3 for the parameters of the single-pulse scheme
(m = 2, Ωs/Ωd ≈ 12), and P (1)
spe(tπ) ≈ 5 · 10−3 for the parameters of the composite scheme
(m = 1, Ωs/Ωd ≈ 7), which are consistent with numerically solving the master equation (S59).
In the future, this error can be reduced by tuning the laser frequencies further from the excited

states at the cost of a reduced coupling strength, which can be compensated by increased laser

power [33]. Another potential solution would be to use a magnetic-ﬁeld gradient to directly

couple the spins to the motion instead of using lasers [43, 44].

In our analytical calculations in Sec. 4.6 we have used the fastest scheme (m = 1) for the

composite pulse scheme. Numerically, we ﬁnd by integration of the master equation (S59) that

this is indeed the preferred parameter choice for the composite-pulse scheme in the presence of

spontaneous emission since longer pulse durations increase the spontaneous emission as shown

in Fig. S7 c).

Assuming spontaneous emission is the only source of incoherent errors, we estimate an error
of the |T(cid:105) state preparation below 0.001 for the single-pulse scheme with a sideband Rabi rate
of 2π × 17.6 kHz, a detuning of 29 THz from the 2P1/2 state, and a weaker microwave drive
with Rabi-frequency 2π × 0.23 kHz. For the composite-pulse scheme with a sideband Rabi rate

38

of 2π × 17.3 kHz, a detuning of 3.8 THz from the 2P1/2 state, and a microwave Rabi-frequency
of 2π × 2.6 kHz, we can achieve the same error.

5.2 Imperfect ground-state cooling

Imperfect cooling results in a non-zero population of excited motional states, described by

their mean occupation number ¯n, here assumed to be a thermal distribution. In this case, the
sideband Hamiltonian Eq. (S14) perturbs the scheme, as it couples |↑↑, n(cid:105) to |S, n − 1(cid:105), so that
|↑↑, n > 0(cid:105) is not a dark state of the laser interaction. The coupling from |↑↑, n(cid:105) to |S, n − 1(cid:105)
results in the formation of two dressed states at energies ∼ ±√
nΩs, whereas |T, n(cid:105) has energy
0. The transition from the two dressed states will thus be off-resonant from |T, n ≥ 1(cid:105) so that
the |T(cid:105) state preparation is suppressed and nearly all |T(cid:105) state population with n ≥ 1 is lost
from the scheme. This results in an error

E¯n ≈ ¯n.

(S64)

In this approximation, the error will be the same both in the single and in the composite pulse
case. Using a thermal distribution with ¯n (cid:46) 6 · 10−3 (estimated from sideband ratios after
cooling) as the initial density matrix of the motion, we numerically solve the master equation
(S59) with the Hamiltonian in Eq. (S12). From this, we found an inﬁdelity of the |T(cid:105) state
due to the imperfect ground-state cooling of less than 6 · 10−3 for the single-pulse scheme and
5 · 10−3 for the composite pulse scheme. The upper bound of this error is comparable to that
caused by spontaneous emission.

The error due to imperfect ground-state cooling could be reduced with two methods. One

method is to tune the Raman sideband laser beams near the second sideband at a frequency
difference ω0 + 2ωs ± δ(cid:48) such that they only couple states separated by two motional quanta. In
this case the scheme will work as long as the motional mode is prepared in either the |n = 0(cid:105)

39

or |n = 1(cid:105) state, however, the laser interaction strength will be smaller by a factor of the Lamb-
Dicke parameter which would lead to slower operation and increased spontaneous emission.

An alternative method is to co-trap other species of ions in an ion chain, for example 9Be+-

25Mg+-9Be+ and use the motional mode where the 25Mg+ ion oscillates out of phase with the
9Be+ ions. With the 25Mg+ ion initialized to |↓Mg(cid:105), a red sideband coupling π pulse driving
|↓Mg, 1(cid:105) → |↑Mg, 0(cid:105) could be applied to the 25Mg+ ion before the scheme is applied, to increase
the probability of initial ground state cooling. Alternatively, after the scheme, the |↓Mg, 1(cid:105) →
|↑Mg, 0(cid:105) pulse could be applied to the 25Mg+ ion, followed by spin detection on the 25Mg+ ion.
If the |↑Mg(cid:105) state is detected, this gives a partial check that an error occurred during the scheme
in which case this preparation sequence could be discarded and we could repeat the preparation

process.

5.3 Ambient heating process

Ambient heating of the motional mode can lead to additional inﬁdelity. However in the two

ion experiment, the motional sideband couples the ions through the stretch mode, which is

insensitive to (uniform) electric ﬁeld noise and has a low heating rate. In general this process

is modeled by Lindblad operators of heating and cooling of the motional mode, respectively

Lheat =
heating rate. This leads to a negligible inﬁdelity for the |T(cid:105) state creation process.

6 Analysis and discussion of experimental imperfections, three-

ion case

Using an analysis similar to Sec. 5, for the case of three ions, we determine that, the inﬁdelity
of the |W(cid:105) state has contributions of 0.010 from spontaneous emission, 0.016 from imperfect
subspace isolation and less than 0.005 from state preparation. Here, we use the COM mode to

40

prepare the |W(cid:105) state. This mode experiences a signiﬁcant ambient heating, approximately 136
quanta/s; simulation indicates this leads to an inﬁdelity of 0.011 for the |W(cid:105) state preparation.
This heating also limits the performance of ground state cooling such that the initial motional
state has ¯n ≈ 0.02, which leads to an inﬁdelity of 0.018 for the |W(cid:105) state preparation.

In addition, due to the unequal illumination caused by the ﬁnite laser beam waist across

the ions, the outer ions experience different AC Stark shifts compared to the center ion, in turn

leading to slightly different spin-ﬂip resonance frequencies. From the measured beam waists

for the two Raman beams of approximately 28 and 21 µm, and the 3.35 µm separation between

neighboring ions, we estimate the inﬁdelity from this effect to be 0.023 for a differential AC
Stark shift of approximately 2π×5 kHz between the center ion and the outer ions. Combining
all known effects, the simulation predicts a maximum of the |W(cid:105) state population of 0.917, in
agreement with the experimental result. Since the inﬁdelity for three ions is dominated by other

sources than considered in Sec. 4, we expect the gain from using a composite pulse to be small

and we do not investigate it here.
