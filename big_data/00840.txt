Abstract. We derive an expression for the phase θ(r) of the order parameter of a superﬂuid placed
on a ﬂat two-dimensional object (either cylinder or torus) in the presence of vortex defects. The

function θ(r) is fully compatible with constraints imposed by the superﬂuid, by the vortices, and

by the object’s geometry. Most eﬀorts are focused on the torus geometry. It is demonstrated that

while any compact geometry requires a vortex defect to be accompanied by an anti-vortex defect, the

ﬂat torus geometry prescribes a minimum of two vortex anti-vortex pairs. A parallelogram, formed

by these four defects, is the minimal conﬁguration compatible with the torus periodic boundary

conditions.

It is shown that values of certain vortex conﬁguration agree with those of harmonic

Maass wave forms.

1. Introduction

This work is motivated by the quest for ﬁnding an exact mathematical expression for an often

encountered quantity, in the analysis of a certain class of quantum many-body physical systems such

as superﬂuids or superconductors, which undergo second-order quantum phase transition. We start by

a brief description of the underlying physical system. A superﬂuid (or superconductor) is described by

a complex order parameter ψ(r; T ), where r is a spatial coordinate and T is an external real parameter

that controls the symmetry of the system.

In a second-order phase transition there is a critical value Tc such that for T > Tc the system has
a high symmetry (encoded by a symmetry group H) and for T < Tc the system has a lower degree
of symmetry (encoded by a symmetry group L). A second order phase transition is encoded (among
others) by the following properties: 1) ψ(r; T ) ≡ 0 for T > Tc and ψ(r; T ) (cid:54)= 0 for T < Tc (except
for possible isolated points {ri} referred to as nodes where ψ(ri; T ) = 0). 2) ψ(r; T ) is continuous in
T , at Tc, but its derivative ∂T ψ(r; T ) is discontinuous. 3) L is a proper subgroup of H. Thus, the
symmetry is broken at a second-order phase transition. Henceforth we assume that T < Tc and drop
the T dependence wherever no confusion may arise.

It is useful to write ψ(r; T ) = |ψ(r; T )| exp(iθ(r; T )) because, as it turns out, the absolute value
|ψ(r)| is rather smooth (sometimes even a constant). Most of the physical content is encoded in
the phase function θ(r), to which we dedicate our attention. For various physical reasons, it is

advantageous to require that the support of ψ(r) is either a two-dimensional cylinder or a two-

dimensional torus. Thus, our main goal is to study the phase function θ(r) for systems where the

order parameter is deﬁned on a cylinder or a torus, and has an even number of nodes referred to

as vortices or anti-vortices. Strictly speaking, quantum vortices are more than just nodes of the

order parameter. They are topological defects, characterized by a ﬁnite quantized winding number,

which appear in superﬂuids and superconductors (charged superﬂuids) when subject to a rotation

or a magnetic ﬁeld, respectively. Vortices play an important role in phase transitions such as the

Kosterlitz-Thouless transition[4] and transport properties such as ﬂux-ﬂow resistivity[3]. Recently,

interest is also focused on the quantum statistics of vortices in two dimensions, which, in some cases,
appears to be non-Abelian.

As an example where a ﬁeld θ(r) needs to be calculated, we brieﬂy analyze a relatively simple

physical model, that is the two dimensional XY-model [5], whose physics apply to superﬂuid and

superconducting ﬁlms as well. Consider a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice and assign a 2D unit
vector Si = (cos θi, sin θi) (rotor) on each lattice site ri = ni ˆx + mi ˆy (ni, mi being integers and ˆx, ˆy
are unit vectors along the Cartesian axes in the Euclidean plane). The dynamics of the XY model is

governed by the Hamiltonian

(1)

H = −J

Si · Sj = −J

cos(θi − θj),

(cid:88)

(cid:104)i,j(cid:105)

(cid:88)

(cid:104)i,j(cid:105)

where (cid:104)i, j(cid:105) denotes nearest neighbour sites such that |ri − rj| = a (the lattice constant). Assuming
the direction of the rotors varies smoothly from site to site we can expand the cosine to second order

in the diﬀerence of angles and replace the discrete diﬀerence operator by the continuous Laplacian
operator treating ri → r as a continuous variable. This leads to the continuum Hamiltonian

(cid:90)

(2)

H = E0 +

dr(∇θ)2.

Here E0 = 2JN is the energy of the completely aligned ground state of N rotors. The XY-model
has no second-order phase transition since the rotor expectation value remains zero for any ﬁnite

temperature. However, a transition from a disordered phase to a quasi-ordered phase can occur. This

(so called) Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, is revealed through the correlation between two spatially

MINIMAL MULTI-VORTEX CONFIGURATIONS ON A FLAT TORUS AND CYLINDER

separated rotors, but this point will not be elaborated upon here. The important point to stress here

is that the physics encoded in the ﬁeld θ(r) in the present XY model is the same as that of a 2D

superﬂuid whose order parameter phase is θ(r). Therefore, it is worth analyzing the structure of the

ﬁeld θ(r). The ﬁeld conﬁgurations corresponding to local minima of H satisfy the condition

(3)

δH
δθ(r)

= 0 ⇒ ∇2θ(r) = 0.

Equation (3) admits two types of solutions. The ﬁrst consists of ground-state conﬁgurations, θ(r) = C,

vorticity at a ﬁnite set of points Rk with k = 1, 2, . . . , K, that is, ∇ × ∇θ(r) = π(cid:80)K

where C is a constant. The second consists of multi vortex conﬁgurations which have quantized
k=1 skδ(r − Rk)ˆn.

Here sk = ± for vortex/anti-vortex, and ˆn is the normal to the surface.

There are some superconductors that extend the XY model in a non-trivial way. Among which,

the chiral p-wave superconductor model, captures special interest due to its potential applications

in quantum computation[6]. A 2D p-wave superconductor supports vortices which bind Majorana

fermion zero energy states[2]. These mobile objects exhibit non-Abelian braiding statistics and can

potentially be used to construct non-local qubits. The qubits are naturally immune to errors since

braiding vortices is sensitive only to the topology of the trajectories, and not to their geometry or

dynamics. Capturing the statistics of vortices can beneﬁt from placing the superconductor on compact

geometries where the vortices can be kept isolated from edge eﬀects.

Elucidating the properties of superﬂuid in compact geometries is of particular interest for two

reasons. First, ﬁeld theoretical calculations often make use of periodic boundary conditions that

maintain translation invariance. Second, numerical procedures with periodic boundary conditions

avoid the occurrence of edge eﬀects that may obscure the physical properties related to the bulk

system.
In some cases, there is a deﬁnite procedure (based on scaling arguments) to deduce the
properties of an inﬁnite system from those of a ﬁnite system with periodic boundary conditions. This

kind of extension is referred to as the thermodynamic limit. Natural examples of ﬂat and compact

manifolds for such calculations is the cylinder or the torus.

To study a superﬂuid residing on a cylinder or a torus we need to properly specify its order

parameter, compatible with the pertinent geometry and the occurrence of vortices.

its phase θ(r) needs to satisfy the conditions for a multi-vortex conﬁguration deﬁned above. The

requirement that the order parameter is single valued implies the relation (cid:72)
(cid:72)
1 ∇θ · dr = 2πn1 (and
2 ∇θ·dr = 2πn2) where the integration contour is chosen around the hole of the cylinder (equivalently
ϕ(cid:48)(r) and ϕ(r) are equivalent iﬀ their diﬀerence, f = ϕ(cid:48) − ϕ, satisﬁes ∇ × ∇f = 0 and(cid:72)
the two holes of the torus). Here n1 (and n2) are the number of vortices through the hole(s). This
relation deﬁnes an equivalence class of phase functions. Explicitly, we say that two phase functions

In particular,

i ∇f · dr = 0

for any path around the two holes (numbered as i = 1, 2).

A useful method to analyze vortices in a superﬂuid residing on a ﬂat torus (or a ﬂat cylinder) is that

of image vortices. The pertinent geometry is embedded in a 2D Euclidean space as a parallelogram of
size qx × qy, which is then replicated inﬁnite many times by tiling the parallelograms with no overlaps
in in the x and y directions (or in the y direction for the cylinder). Then, the arguments of the vectors

connecting a point (x, y) on the torus (or the cylinder) and the entire set of image vortices, occupying
lattice points (x0 + mqx, y0 + nqy) with m, n ∈ Z are summed (replaced by a summation over n only

lim

A−→∞

n,m=−A

where A denotes the shell number and ∆x = x− x0 (∆y = y− y0). Roughly speaking, this summation
can be organized as a sum over “shells” of images (numbered as k = 1, 2, . . .) around the origin (with

shell k + 1 farther than shell k), and a summation within each shell. The sum rapidly converges

(modulo π) with the number K of shells. (a rigorous statement and proof are given below). The

outcome is then lifted to the interval [0, 2π) (in the exact manner that the function atan2 is a lift of

the function arctan). This procedure leads us to the main result of the article: A precise deﬁnition

and a closed form expression, for the phase functions for the cylinder and the torus in the presence of

vortices, as appear in deﬁnitions 2.4 and 3.3, respectively.

Our analysis reveals peculiar characteristics of the torus phase function as appear in corollaries

4.5 and 4.6. While the compact geometry necessitates every vortex will be accompanied by an anti-

vortex, the ﬂat geometry prescribes another constraint. For the cylinder, trivially (although not

compact), this will result in every vortex being accompanied by an anti-vortex. More interestingly,

for the torus, every vortex line penetrates the torus in exactly four points, which are always on the

corners of a parallelogram (accordingly, if a torus is prepared by gluing a piece of paper cut to a

parallelogram across two pairs of parallel edges and ﬂattening it, then punching a hole through the

paper will generate another parallelogram, with the two vortices placed on opposing vertices, and the

R(cid:46)

two anti-vortices on the other opposing pair).

The structure of this paper is as follows: In sections 2 and 3 we discuss the argument function on
πZ, over
the arguments of all copies of the point in the plane. We then lift these functions to functions from
R2 to
2πZ which agrees, for nearby points, with the usual argument function. In section 4 we use
the argument function deﬁned in section 3 to study placements of vortices on “right-angled ” tori. In

section 5 we rewrite the phase function and the vortex conﬁgurations for general tori. In section 6 we
consider certain vortex conﬁgurations on a fundamental domain of SL2 (Z) and prove that they can
be extended to an harmonic Maass wave form on the upper half-plane. We refer the the reader to the

appendix for deﬁnitions and properties of certain functions used in the paper.

2. Generalizing the Argument function for a cylinder geometry

In this section we generalize the argument function to a ﬂat cylinder C of circumference qy > 0.

Remark 3.6. In the process of this computation we ﬁrst “folded” the plane to a cylinder about the

x -axis and then “folded” the cylinder to a torus about the y-axis. We now describe the result of

“folding” the plane about the y-axis ﬁrst instead. It follows from eq. (35) that

we take the local basis corresponding to (cid:104)−y, x(cid:105) and rotate by π

2 radians anti clock-wise.

4. Vortex Configurations on Flat Right-Angled Tori

In this section, we consider possible placements of vortices on a ﬂat right-angled torus of the form

Λ = qxZ(cid:98)x + qyZ(cid:98)y

for qx, qy > 0. We also characterize families of such vortex conﬁgurations deﬁned for all ﬂat right-
angled torus. We start by constructing a vortex conﬁguration on the plane. Namely, for r0, r1, . . . , rm−1 ∈
R2 and k0, ..., km−1 ∈ Z let

(17)

Θ (r) = Θr0,r1,...,rm−1,k0,...,km−1 (r) =

kiΦT (r − ri, qx, qy) .

m−1(cid:88)

i=0

We pose the following questions:
Question 4.1. For which conﬁgurations r0, r1, . . . , rm−1 ∈ R2 and k0, ..., km−1 ∈ Z the function
Θr0,r1,...,rm−1,k0,...,km−1 (r) is Λ-periodic for a given rank 2 free lattice Λ in R2?
Question 4.2. For which conﬁgurations r0, r1, . . . , rm−1 ∈ R2 and k0, ..., km−1 ∈ Z the function
Θr0,r1,...,rm−1,k0,...,km−1 (r) is Λ-periodic for any rank 2 free lattice Λ in R2?

(cid:3)
for all qx, qy > 0.

Considering the case m = 2 and m = 4 with ki = (−1)i. We draw two immediate corollaries.

Corollary 4.5. There is no possible vortex conﬁguration Θr0,r1,1,−1 (r) (a vortex-antivortex pair)
which is Λ-periodic for all right-angled rank 2 free lattices Λ in R2.

Corollary 4.6. The vortex conﬁguration Θr0,...,r3,1,...,−1 (r) is Λ-periodic for all right-angled rank
2 free lattices Λ in R2 if and only if r0r1, r2 and r3 are the edges of a a parallelogram where r0
is opposed to r2 and r1 is opposed to r3; namely the vortices are placed on an opposing pair of
vertices and the antivortices on the other opposing pair.

Remark 4.7. Note that it is possible that r0 = r2 or r1 = r3 and the parallelogram becomes a line.

5. Phase Functions and Vortex Configuration on General Tori

In previous sections we discussed the phase function and vortex conﬁgurations on right-angled tori.

In certain instances it is beneﬁcial to describe them on general tori. We rewrite Equation (15) using

the following change of variables

Remark 5.2. We note that τ2 is a mediator of scalings and rotations on the torus. Any combination
of such operations can be viewed as multiplying z by reiθ ∈ C× (which yields a scaling by r > 0 and
a rotation by an angle of θ). We note that it holds that

(24)
Namely, rotation of z by θ and scaling by r is equivalent to a rotation of τ1 and τ2 by −θ and a scaling

We further recall that for lattices Λ, Λ(cid:48) ⊂ C the exist a biholomorphic isomorphism between

Λ(cid:48) if and only if there exists w ∈ C× such that Λ = wΛ(cid:48).
For points z0, ..., zn−1 ∈ C and k0, ..., kn−1 ∈ Z we deﬁne a vortex conﬁguration to be

(25)

Θ (z) =

kiΦT (z − zi, τ1, τ2) .

i=0

As mentioned in 4.4, one can show that 4.3 holds also for vortex conﬁgurations on a general
tori. In the next section, we will show that for n = 4, placing the vortices on a square aligned in π
4
radians and normalizing the system so that τ2 the vortex conﬁguration at z = 0 takes the values of
an harmonic Maass form.

6. Vortex Configurations as Maass Wave Forms

Maass wave forms. We recall the fundamental domain

A simple test proves the following curious result

Lemma 6.3. The function κ is harmonic with respect to both variables. Namely:

(1) Given the ﬂat Laplacian ∆ on R2 and writing z = x + iy we have ∆κ (x + iy, τ ) ≡ 0.
(2) Given the hyperbolic Laplacian ∆0, as in the appendix, and writing τ = x + iy we have

∆0κ (z, x + iy) ≡ 0.

The function κ (0, τ ) is a function on F, we now prove that it can be extended to an harmonic
Maass form of wight 0 with respect to SL2 (Z). We recall that for any τ ∈ H there exists τ0 ∈ F and
γ ∈ Γ such that τ = γ · τ0. Moreover, unless τ0 ∈ ∂F the element γ is unique.
Deﬁnition 6.4. For any τ ∈ H let τ0 ∈ F and γ ∈ Γ such that τ = γ · τ0. Let

Ω (τ ) = Ω (γ · τ0) = κ (0, τ0) .

One notes that

(1) Ω is well deﬁned due to:

Claim: For any τ ∈ ∂F it holds that κ (0,−τ ) = κ (0, τ ).

(4) ∆0Ω ≡ 0 since the composition of an harmonic function and a conformal map is again har-
monic. Indeed, let τ , τ0 and γ be as in the deﬁnition of Ω and let τ = x + iy and τ0 = x0 + iy0.
As a M¨obius transformation, γ−1 is conformal and holomorphic at a neighbourhood of τ0. We
write γ−1·τ(cid:48) = u (τ(cid:48))+iv (τ(cid:48)) as the real and imaginary part of this map at this neighborhood.
It then holds that

We now recall that by the holomorphicity of γ−1 it follows that u and v are harmonic and
satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, namely

ux = −vy, uy = vx, uxx + uyy = vxx + vyy = 0.

(cid:104)

(ux)2 + (vx)2(cid:105)

(τ ) = 0,

Plugging this into the above equation yields

y2∆0Ω (τ ) = [κuu + κvv] (τ0)

since κ is harmonic.

It follows that:

Proposition 6.5. Ω is a Maass wave form is a (real valued) Maass wave form of weight 0 for SL2 (Z)
with eigenvalue 0. Namely Ω is an harmonic Maass form of weight 0 of SL2 (Z).

Remark 6.6. We note that for 0 < r < 1 we have Ω (ir) = κ (0, ir) due to 3.6.
