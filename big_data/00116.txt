Abstract

We state and prove a general result establishing that T-duality simpliﬁes the
bulk-boundary correspondence, in the sense of converting it to a simple geometric
restriction map. This settles in the aﬃrmative several earlier conjectures of the
authors, and provides a clear geometric picture of the correspondence. In particular,
our result holds in arbitrary spatial dimension, in both the real and complex cases,
and also in the presence of disorder, magnetic ﬁelds, and H-ﬂux. These special cases
are relevant both to String Theory and to the study of the quantum Hall eﬀect and
topological insulators with defects in Condensed Matter Physics.

Introduction

1
A succession of insights, starting with Kane–Mele’s invariant [19] and culminating in
[21, 13, 46], led to an understanding and classiﬁcation of topological insulators in terms
of K-theory. The connection to K-theory is particularly important in view of earlier
rigorous work on the quantum Hall eﬀect [2, 20]. These developments also provided new
insight into how the K-theory of bulk and boundary systems are related. For various
reasons it is actually closer to the spirit of condensed matter theory, as well as more
ﬂexible and appropriate, to use the more general C∗-algebraic K-theory rather than the
topological version [3]. The availability of C∗-algebraic machinery also opens the way to
describe the same system in diﬀerent forms, using powerful tools such as T-duality and
the closely related Baum–Connes isomorphisms.

Whilst the geometric relationship between bulk and boundary is most simply ex-
pressed in position space, the physics of Brillouin zones and Fermi levels is more trans-
parent in momentum space. T-duality moves between geometric and physical descriptions
rather as the Fourier transform ﬂips position and momentum space in wave mechanics,
and a recent series of papers has shown that the rather complicated map relating the phys-
ical bulk and boundary K-theory of topological insulators transforms under T-duality into
the obvious geometrical restriction map [28, 29, 30, 18]. Schematically, these results say
that the following diagram commutes in many examples of physical interest:

Real space bulk invariant

∼

T−duality

/ Momentum space bulk invariant

Restriction
to boundary

bulk-boundary
homomorphism

∼

T−duality

Real space boundary invariant

/ Momentum space boundary invariant
(1)
Thus momentum space topological invariants (e.g. as deﬁned over a Brilluoin torus)
transform isomorphically under T-duality into real space invariants, in such a way that
the bulk-boundary homomorphism becomes the simple geometric restriction-to-boundary
map.

The main result of this paper is the formalization and conceptual proof of the com-
mutativity of diagram 1 in a very general setting. This result can then be specialized
to analyze the bulk-boundary correspondence in: (1) arbitrary spatial dimensions, (2) in
both the real and complex cases, (3) in the presence of disorder and/or magnetic ﬁelds,
and (4) in the presence of H-ﬂux. We had previously worked in some special subcases in
which the groups of topological invariants in all four corners of diagram 1, or at least the
interesting ones, are computable; then commutativity was veriﬁed by chasing around the
diagram generator-by-generator. Getting a concrete hold of the generators can be very
useful when studying particular systems. Nevertheless there are situations, particularly
when disorder is modelled in the mathematical description, in which the relevant topo-
logical invariants are not easily computable. Our abstract proof then becomes valuable

and represents a signiﬁcant advance compared to our earlier results.

The physical importance of the ﬁrst three cases is well-known and was also discussed in
our earlier papers, so let us brieﬂy elaborate on the fourth case. H-ﬂuxes live in degree-3
cohomology and are important in string theory, although it seldom appears in condensed
matter physics. However, as noted in [18], they can be used to describe screw dislocations.
More precisely, defects such as screw dislocations break the Z2d+1 translation symmetry
of the original (2d + 1)D Euclidean lattice underlying a (2d + 1)D insulator, so that
standard constructions like unit cells and Brillouin zones are not available. This means
that topological invariants in the presence of defects are not easily deﬁned using standard
methods appealing to Bloch theory. We can circumvent this diﬃculty by requiring the
defects to be distributed in a regular manner, allowing us to deﬁne topological invariants
which are, in a precise sense, deformed versions of the usual ones arising from Bloch theory
[18]. Indeed, the non-isotropy introduced by the defects is expected to be reﬂected in
boundary phenomena in the form of gapless modes localized along the dislocations [37].

direction. A circuit of horizontal translations enclosing the dislocation ends at a lattice site
which diﬀers from the starting point by a vertical translation.

There may be other applications, e.g. Dirac monopoles are known to be described by
3-cocycles [49]. Although monopoles have proved elusive, analogues have been created
in condensed matter. Bramwell et al. have detected them through the magnetic Wien
eﬀect in spin ices, in particular, in single crystals of cubic Dy2Ti2O7, [5], whilst Ray et
al. have produced detailed observations in a 87Rb Bose–Einstein condensate, [38].

Outline
Section 2 provides an overview of various T-duality transformations, applied to the bulk-
boundary correspondence in a variety of settings. The algebras for the bulk and boundary
from both the geometrical and physical perspective are deﬁned very generally in Section
3. Theorem 3.5 and Corollary 3.6 formalizes the commutative diagram 1 in this general
setting. The Dixmier–Douady classes, or H-ﬂuxes, provide the main focus in Section 4,
and we prove our [18, Conjecture 2.1] in Theorem 4.1. Section 5 contains examples and
also generalisations of the discrete Heisenberg groups, which play an important role in
[18] and often arise as symmetry groups in physical systems. The example of the three di-
mensional solvable group is also discussed here. In Section 6, we study the bulk-boundary
correspondence for the higher dimensional quantum Hall eﬀect, as well as topological in-
sulators with disorder in both the real and complex cases, generalising the 2D results of
[29] and the higher-dimensional results without disorder in [30]. The Appendix explains

3

why Paschke’s map [32] is essentially the same as the Connes–Thom isomorphism [6],
both in the complex case and in the real case. The Paschke map implements a type of
T-duality transformation in 1D, and we derive his explicit formula starting from abstract
arguments.

2 Overview of T-duality applied to bulk-boundary

correspondence

Formalizing and proving commutativity of diagram 1 is signiﬁcant because it

• rigorously captures the geometric intuition behind the bulk-boundary correspon-
• simpliﬁes the complicated (momentum space) boundary map deﬁned at the level of
• continues to hold even when the momentum space is noncommutative (as in the
IQHE), in the presence of disorder [29], in the real case (relevant for time-reversal
symmetry), and in the parametrised and twisted setting of [16, 17] (relevant to
string theory in the presence of H-ﬂux [4]).

At the mathematical level, the meta-principle expressed by the diagram naturally gener-
alizes a simple phenomenon already present at the level of ordinary Fourier transforms:
integration in Fourier space, which can be understood topologically as a push-forward
map, picks out the constant Fourier mode, so it is equivalent to the Fourier transform of
a “restriction-to-zero” map.

Physicists usually exploit an assumed Zd translational symmetry (e.g. due to a periodic
potential provided by a regular atomic lattice in Euclidean space) to deﬁne bulk/boundary
topological invariants in quasi-momentum space. Namely, one constructs from a Zd-
symmetric Hamiltonian, Bloch vector bundles of single-electon states over the Brillouin
torus Td, which in turn deﬁne elements in the K-theory of Td. In more realistic models
which incorporate magnetic ﬁelds and disorder, the Brillouin zone may be noncommuta-
tive and the analogous construction yields elements in the K-theory of a twisted crossed
product by Zd [3]. It is therefore customary to start with the physical picture involving
C∗-algebras of observables, and then T-dualize to obtain the geometrical one, but the
exposition in this paper is a bit simpler if one starts with the geometric picture.

In any case, the intuition behind the bulk-boundary correspondence in physics is
largely a geometrical one. For example, in a semiclassical picture of the IQHE, the
electrons in the bulk are conﬁned to cyclotron orbits in the plane of the sample due
to the applied perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld. These circular orbits are intercepted by
a geometrical boundary, leading to chiral edge currents, see Figure 2. The chirality of
the edge phenomena also highlights a crucial necessary ingredient in modelling bulk-
boundary correspondences. Namely, although we are free to deﬁne topological invariants
for the boundary system considered on its own, it is only from some intrinsic geometrical
relationship between the boundary system and the bulk system that we can extract a
notion of chirality. Furthermore, not all possible boundary invariants are relevant, but
only those which “lift” to an invariant associated to the bulk system. Mathematically,
this says that there should be a homomorphism mapping from bulk topological invariants

to boundary ones, which need not be surjective or injective, and which is derived in a
strong sense from some geometrical data about how the boundary is related to the bulk.
Geometrically we can visualise the bulk as a sort of ﬁnite or semi-inﬁnite closed “cylin-
der” with cross-section the boundary, and the interior of the bulk as the corresponding
open cylinder. We denote the algebras corresponding to the boundary, the bulk, and the
interior as E, B, and I, respectively. (In the simplest cases they are just the functions on
the geometric spaces deﬁned by their spectra.) Then the interior, I, may be considered as
the part of the bulk algebra “vanishing” on the boundary, and we have the exact sequence

0 −→ I −→ B −→ E −→ 0,

where B −→ E is the geometrical restriction-to-boundary map. Standard theory enables
us to extract from this short exact sequence an exact hexagon of the operator algebraic
K-groups:

K0(I) −→ K0(B) −→ K0(E)
K1(E) ←− K1(B) ←− K1(I).

The geometric relationship between the interior and boundary algebras, described in
more detail in the next section, means that their K-theories diﬀer only by a degree shift,

From the physical perspective the bulk, boundary, and interior algebras of observables,

denoted by bB, bE, bI, are the T-duals of their geometric counterparts, which are related by
the fact that bB and bE ﬁt in an extension,
where T is a Toeplitz-like algebra [48] associated with bE and bB [34]. One can show that
the K-theories of T and bE coincide, leading to another similar exact hexagon of K-groups:

Table 1: Table of T-duality transformations

As explained in detail in [34], the Toeplitz extension algebra T may be interpreted as
the bulk-with-boundary algebra, and vertical connecting maps ∂ in this diagram may be
identiﬁed as the physical bulk-boundary homomorphism.

As we explain in Section 3, T-duality simply interchanges the geometric and physical

perspectives B ↔ bB, E ↔ bE. So far we have not said anything detailed about the maps

in our exact hexagons, but we shall see that the geometric description is much simpler,
and that the two hexagons encode the same information. (Strictly speaking the T-dual
of the geometric bulk algebra is only stably equivalent to the physical bulk algebra, but
that gives the same K-theory.) In particular, the bulk-boundary homomorphism ∂ which
we are interested in becomes the geometric restriction map under T-duality, as one might
expect from heuristics.

The precise K-theory groups which are relevant for a given physical system vary in
complexity, and accordingly, there are T-duality transformations of varying intricacy as
summarized in Table 1. The ﬁrst three rows had been dealt with in previous papers
[28, 29, 30]. In this paper, we focus on the last three rows, which subsume the ﬁrst three.

3 Bulk and boundary algebras
To reﬂect physical features of the problem, such as Brillouin zones, we introduce some
lattices. On the geometric side, let L, M, and N = L ⊕ M be lattices of maximal rank
in the vector spaces U, V , and W = U ⊕ V , of dimension 1, d − 1, and d, respectively,
with d ≥ 1. W will be associated with the bulk, V with the boundary directions, and U
with the direction transverse to the boundary. We concentrate here on the case where
the boundary has codimension 1, so that U (cid:27) R and L (cid:27) Z, though the arguments have
been written to suggest a way to include higher-codimensional boundaries. The main
diﬀerences lie in the parity of the K-groups linked by Connes–Thom maps and the fact
that there can be Mackey obstructions for the boundary.

Usually, it is only the additive group structure of the spaces and lattices which appears

6

in actions as automorphisms of the algebras. In all the physical examples that we will
consider, E is a C∗-algebra equipped with commuting actions τ : V → Aut(E) and
α : L → Aut(E). Physically, τ is supposed to encode information about translational
symmetries parallel to the boundary1, while α encodes a transverse Z-covariance (e.g.
with respect to the position of the boundary). We will often write α‘ for the action of
‘ ∈ L (cid:27) Z, so that α will be used both for the action and for its generator.

As already noted, an obvious way to model the interior would be as an open cylinder
on the boundary, and, for an inﬁnite cylinder, we could make this more precise by taking
the interior algebra to be continuous E-valued functions on U (cid:27) R: I = C0(U,E). The
bulk algebra B, is then deﬁned to be the induced algebra IndU
L(E, α), of continuous E-
valued functions on U, which satisfy the “periodicity” condition f(u − ‘) = α‘[f(u)] for
u ∈ U, ‘ ∈ Z; (‘ counts the number of lattice spacings in L). If α deﬁned a character of L
then the “periodicity” would give Bloch–Floquet type functions. There is automatically
a translation action τ α of U on B = IndU
L(E, α), which combines with the action of V on
E to give an action of W on B. This action provides a reason to use the induced algebra
rather than the mapping torus (5) of which it is the periodic extension. The basic setup
is summarized as follows:
Basic setup.

• U = R, V = Rd−1, W = U ⊕ V = Rd with standard lattices L = Z ⊂ U, M =

Zd−1 ⊂ V , N = Zd = L ⊕ M ⊂ W.

• The geometrical boundary algebra E is a real or complex separable C∗-algebra.
• There are commuting continuous homomorphisms τ : V → Aut(E) and α : L →

Aut(E) where Aut(E) is given the topology of pointwise convergence.

• The geometrical bulk algebra B is IndU
L(E, α), and so inherits from E an action
τ α × τ of W = U ⊕ V (cid:27) Rd.
• The T-dual boundary algebra is the crossed product bE (cid:66) E (cid:111)τ V , while the T-dual
bulk algebra is bB (cid:66) E (cid:111)τ α×τ W.

For notational ease, we will sometimes drop the action from the crossed product
symbol when it is understood. This basic general setup will be specialized in later sections.
Our arguments in this section work equally well for real or complex E with appropriate
modiﬁcations, so we will proceed with the assumption that all algebras are complex
C∗-algebras, for which there are two complex K-theory groups K•(·), • ∈ Z2.

From the above setup, we have the exact sequence

1There may be no such symmetries even if the boundary occupies n ≥ 1 dimensions, for instance, it
may not be completely straight. Generally speaking, the collection of boundary symmetries determine
what topological invariants may be associated to it, and the more symmetries there are, the more
boundary invariants are available.

where, identifying U with R, the homomorphism i : C0(U,E) → IndU
L(E, α) sends a
function F to i(F)(u) = α(−buc)[F(cot(πu))], and the map ε : IndU
L(E, α) → E is just
evaluation at 0, in other words, it restricts from the bulk to the boundary. Each algebra
inherits actions of V and L from E, and, by construction, the maps i and ε are equivariant
for these actions.

Since I is the suspension of E, their K-groups agree apart from a degree shift. Write S for

we can rewrite the diagram and the vertical connecting homomorphisms in the form

where the subscript star indicates the induced maps on K-theory, and (α(1)−1)∗ has been

It is possible to use ﬁnite rather than inﬁnite cylinders in deﬁning the interior and
bulk algebras, We replace the interior algebra by C0((0, 1),E), (where the subscript just
means that the functions vanish on the boundary), and the bulk algebra by the mapping
torus:

Tα(E) = {f ∈ C([0, 1]) : f(1) = α[f(0)]}.

(5)
There is the obvious inclusion map C0((0, 1),E) → Tα(E), and evaluation at 0 maps
Tα(E) → E, just as in the inﬁnite case. This is entirely consistent with the previous case.

Proof. The horizontal maps have all been deﬁned, so we shall just deﬁne ϕ and ψ, and
leave the reader to verify commutativity. First, for F ∈ C0(U,E) and θ ∈ (0, 1), we
set ϕ(F)(θ) := α(1)[F(− cot(πθ))], and check that ϕ(F) ∈ C0(0, 1). This deﬁnes an
isomorphism because cot(πt) deﬁnes a homeomorphism (0, 1) → R. We use the ﬂoor buc
and ceiling due to denote u when u is integral, and otherwise the nearest integer smaller
than or larger than u, respectively. For f ∈ Tα(E) we deﬁne ψ(f)(u) := α(−due)[f(due−
u)]. It is obvious that ψ(f) is continuous for u (cid:60) Z, and near an integer ‘ we have, for
 ∈ (0, 1): ψ(f)(‘ − ) = α(−‘)[f()], and ψ(f)(‘ + ) = α(−(‘ + 1))[f(1 − )], which
tend to α(−‘)[f(0)] and α(−(‘ + 1))[f(1)] respectively, and these are the same due to
the mapping torus condition. We then check that ψ(f)(u − ‘) = α(‘)[ψ(f)(u)], so that
ψ(f) ∈ IndU

short exact sequence

We now take the crossed product of the geometric short exact sequence (2) by V (an
we write bE = E (cid:111) V for the T-dual boundary algebra, and similarly bB = B (cid:111) W for the
exact group), which acts on every term through its action on E. As in the basic setup,
physical T-dual bulk algebra. The action α extends to an action bα on the crossed product
bE. Note that B (cid:111) V (cid:27) IndU
L(bE,bα), since the action τ of V on E commutes with that of L.
Also, I (cid:111) V (cid:27) C0(U, bE) = S(bE), the suspension, so the eﬀect of applying (cid:111)V to (2) is the
0 −→ S(bE) bi−→ IndU

where  is inclusion into the crossed product and ∂ is the connecting boundary map. A
natural question is whether the maps in the two hexagons (7) (the “mapping torus PV

This question is related to Paschke’s succinct distillation, [32], of a key construction
in the proof of Connes’ Thom Theorem, [6]. Connes had initially shown, using his Thom
isomorphism, that the K-theory of a mapping torus for a Z-algebra E is isomorphic to
the degree-shifted K-theory of the crossed product of E by Z. This led to an alternative
derivation of the “mapping torus PV sequence” without recourse to the Toeplitz long
exact sequence, and is essentially what we used to obtain (7). On the other hand, Paschke

K•(Tα(bE)) → K•+1(bE (cid:111)bα L) are exactly such that bε∗ = ∂ ◦ γ•bα and γ•bα ◦bj∗ = ∗. In the
theorem, thus our φU, like γ•bα, does indeed satisfy (9). We also rederive Paschke’s explicit
Theorem 3.5. (c.f. [6, 32].) The K-groups for the T-dual boundary algebra bE = E (cid:111) V
and the T-dual bulk algebra bB = B(cid:111)W ∼stable bE (cid:111)bα L are related by the following Pimsner–

formula starting from a simple axiomatic characterization of such maps.

where TW is T-duality with respect to the W action on bB and TV is T-duality with respect

T-duality interchanges the geometrical restriction map with the Toeplitz bulk-boundary
map.

4 Flux and deformations
To connect these results with [18, Conjecture 2.1] we need to consider K-theory twisted
by a Dixmier–Douady 3-form (a H-ﬂux). There, we started with the product bundle
B = X × Td, on which there is a 3-form H-ﬂux H ∈ H3(B, Z). We will assume in
this section that X is locally compact second-countable Hausdorﬀ (thus paracompact).
We regard B as a trivial principal torus bundle, with a ﬁbrewise action of Td = W/N.
The H-twisted K-theory of B can be identiﬁed with the K-theory of the associated
stable complex continuous-trace algebra B = CT(B, H) with Dixmier–Douady invariant

H(B) = H, where we recall that B is locally isomorphic to C0(B,K) but globally twisted
according to H. We can dimensionally reduce H by the K¨unneth theorem, writing
H = H1 + H2 + H3 where

Hj ∈ H j(X, H3−j(Td, Z)) = H j(X, Z) ⊗ H3−j(Td, Z),

j = 1, 2, 3,

thus the j-th component of H has j “legs” on the base X and 3−j “legs” on the ﬁbers Td.
Generally, there should also be a H0 term, but we assume that it vanishes so as to avoid
problems with nonassociativity when passing to the T-dual. Note that H3 is supported
entirely on the base, and we use the same symbol whether we regard it as living on X
or on a torus bundle over X. As explained in [17] (see also Sect. 5.1.1), B = CT(B, H)
the parametrised deformation quantization bB = CT(bB, H3)σ, where the T-dual spectrum
has an action of W = Rd covering the Td action on B. Its T-dual under this W action is
bBH2 is a Td bundle over X with Chern class H2, and σ is the parametrised deformation
built out of H1.
Consider the subtorus V /M = Td−1 ⊂ W/N. Under the inclusion ι : E = X ×
Td−1 → X × Td = B, there is a restriction map in twisted K-theory, ι∗ : K−•(B, H) →
K−•(E, ι∗H). We can also dimensionally reduce the restricted H-ﬂux

ι∗H = (ι∗H)1 + (ι∗H)2 + (ι∗H)3,

(ι∗H)j ∈ H j(X, Z) ⊗ H3−j(Td−1, Z),

bE = CT(bE, H3)ι∗σ, where bE is a Td−1 bundle with Chern class ι∗H2 and ι∗σ is the
and it is easy to see that (ι∗H)j = ι∗Hj. The T-dual of E = CT(E, ι∗H) is then
as U/L, we can identify, up to Morita equivalence, bB = CT(bB, H3)σ with a crossed
restricted deformation parameter associated to ι∗H1. With the d-th circle T(d) identiﬁed
product of bE by L [18], then there is a PV boundary map ∂ : K•(bB) → K•+1(bE).

M(X , β) and CT(B, H) = IndW

Proof. Let L = Z, M = Zd−1, N = L ⊕ M and U = R, V = Rd−1, W = U ⊕ V as before,
and T = T(d) = U/L, Td−1 = V /M, Td = W/N. By “ﬂux-generation” through Corollary
4.3 below, there is an N = L⊕ M-action α× β on an algebra X such that CT(E, ι∗H) =
N (X , α × β). Then E ≡ CT(E, ι∗H) has the usual
IndV
translation action τ β by V which commutes with α, while B ≡ CT(B, H) (cid:27) IndU
L(E, α);
also B has the translation action τ α × τ β of W, and evaluation at 0 is the restriction ι∗ to
E. We are thus in the situation of Corollary 3.6, and the commutativity of (10) follows.
(cid:3)

Before proving Corollary 4.3, which was used in the proof of the above Theorem,
we recall some general facts about the spectra and ﬂuxes of induced algebras under
spectrum-preserving actions [35]. By a result of Rosenberg, [42, Corollary 2.2], [11], a
spectrum preserving action of N = Zd on a continuous-trace algebra X with spectrum X
is locally inner, so for instance, n ∈ N is implemented by ad(ρ(n)) with ρ(n) unitary on
neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the induced algebra is again a continuous-trace algebra
with spectrum X × Td as a (trivial) principal Td bundle, with the induced Rd translation
action lifting the Td action (Prop. 3.2 of [35]). There is also a precise relationship between
the Dixmier–Douady invariants (ﬂuxes) for X , and the induced algebra given by Prop.
3.4 of [35]. We will only need the special case of a Z-action, which will be iterated.
A spectrum-preserving automorphism α ∈ AutC0(X)(X ) on X is not usually globally
inner; rather, Phillips and Raeburn gave an exact sequence characterising this failure
when X is stable:

0 −→ Inn(X ) −→ AutC0(X)(X )

ζ−→ H2(X, Z) −→ 0.

Thus the class ζ(α) ∈ H2(X, Z) measures the obstruction to realising α as a global inner
automorphism ad(ρ). To ﬁnd ζ(α) [36, Theorem 5.42] one chooses an open covering {Xj}
for X such that for each x ∈ Xj one can write the spectrum-preserving transformation
α = α(1) as ad(ρj(x)). One then ﬁnds transition functions between ρj and ρk, and
proceeds exactly as in the line bundle classiﬁcation to get the class ζ(α) ∈ H2(X, Z). In
eﬀect, ζ(α) is just the Chern class c1(L) of the line bundle L whose ﬁbre over x ∈ Xj is
just Cρj(x), whose nonzero elements are precisely those implementing α in Xj, whether
unitary or not. (The unitary implementers form a principal U(1)-bundle.) Furthermore,
the ﬂuxes H(X ) ∈ H3(X, Z) and H(IndR
Z(X , α)) ∈ H3(X × T, Z) are related by ([35, Cor.
3.5])

(11)
where πX is the projection X × T → X, and z is the generator of H1(T) (the standard
volume form dθ if we use diﬀerential forms).
We will use these results to produce an arbitrary ﬂux H ∈ H3(X×Td, Z) (with H0 = 0)
by inducing from a suitable N = Zd action on X . This gives an explicit construction for
the abstract result given in [10] Lemma 8.1. We start with the following three basic ways
to “generate ﬂux” by induction.
M1: Let f : X → T = K(Z, 1) be a continuous function representing a class η ∈ H1(X, Z).
Deﬁne a Z2 action β1 on C0(X,K) as follows: the ﬁrst group generator acts on the
copy of K = K(L2(T)) at x by conjugation by the operator of multiplication by the
identity function T → T; the second generator acts by conjugation by the operator of

H(IndR

Z(X , α)) = π∗

XH(X ) + z ∪ ζ(α),

13

translation by f(x). These two operators commute up to a scalar, giving a projective
representation of Z2, so their adjoint actions on K commute. Then
Z2(C0(X,K), β1) (cid:27) CT(X × T2, η ∪ z1 ∪ z2),

IndR2

(12)

where z1, z2 are the generators of H1(T(1), Z) and H1(T(2), Z) respectively. This is
basically the example in Section 5 of [27].

M2: Let µ ∈ H2(X, Z), and let β2 ∈ AutC0(X)(C0(X,K)) such that ζ(β2) = µ (this exists

since C0(X,K) is stable and ζ is surjective). Then

IndR

Z(C0(X,K), β2) (cid:27) CT(X × T, z ∪ µ).

(13)
M3: Let H3 ∈ H3(X), then the balanced tensor product C0(X,K) ⊗X CT(X, H3) still
has spectrum X and ﬂux H3. This is essentially Brauer multiplication (c.f. Section
6.1 of [36]).
Recall that H∗(Td, Z) is isomorphic as a graded ring to the exterior algebra (over Z)
on d generators zi, i = 1, . . . , d, with H1(T(i)) = Z[zi]. Thus we can further decompose
each Hj in H = H1 + H2 + H3 ∈ H3(X × Td, Z) into a Z-linear combination of elementary
tensors:

ηkl ∪ zk ∪ zl,

ηkl ∈ H1(X, Z),

µk ∈ H2(X, Z),

H1 = X
dX

H2 =

1≤k<l≤d

zk ∪ µk,

(14)

(15)

Zd(X , γ).

while H3 needs no further decomposition. The restrictions ι∗H1, ι∗H2 are given by a
similar decomposition except that 1 ≤ k < l ≤ d − 1.
Proposition 4.2 (c.f.. 8.1 of [10]). Let H ∈ H3(X×Td, Z) with vanishing H0 component,
and let X be a stable continuous-trace algebra with spectrum X and ﬂux H3. There is an
action γ of Zd on X such that CT(X × Td, H) (cid:27) IndRd
Proof. We may assume that X has a suﬃciently large number of balanced tensor product
factors C0(X,K) with K = K(L2(T)), together with one factor of CT(X, H3) contributing
the H3 ﬂux component. Each ﬂux component of H in (14)-(15) can be produced by
deﬁning a suitable action of the generators of Zd on copies of C0(X,K) in X , using
method M1 or M2 above. For example, ηkl ∪ zk ∪ zl is produced by letting the k-th and
l-th generators of Zd act non-trivially only on one C0(X,K) factor as in M1; similarly
zk ∪ µk is produced by letting the k-th generator act on (a diﬀerent copy of) C0(X,K) as
in M2. Compose all of these actions for each k to obtain d commuting Z actions on X .
The result follows from (11), (12), (13), and the fact that inducing from Zd to Rd is the
same as iteratively inducing from Z to R.
(cid:3)
Corollary 4.3. Let H ∈ H3(X × Td, Z) with vanishing H0 component, and let ι be the
inclusion X × Td−1 → X × Td. There is an action α × β of Z ⊕ Zd−1 on a C∗-algebra X ,
such that CT(X × Td−1, ι∗H) (cid:27) IndRd−1

inner automorphisms of C0(X,K) without changing the resulting ﬂux of the induced
If CT(X × Td, H) is given together with a particular Rd-action
algebra IndRd
covering that on X × Td, there is a spectrum-preserving Zd action γ0 on C0(X,K) =
Zd(X , γ0) (cid:27) CT(X × Td, H) as Rd-algebras
CT(X × {0}, H|X×{0}) by restriction, and IndRd
[10]. The actions γ0 and γ are exterior equivalent, so the crossed products C0(X,K) (cid:111)γ0 Zd
and C0(X,K) (cid:111)γ Zd, which are (Morita equivalent to) the T-duals of IndRd
Zd(X , γ0) and
IndRd

Zd(X , γ), are isomorphic.

5 Examples: Heisenberg and solvable groups
Consider E = IndV
M(X , β), where X is a continuous-trace algebra on X, with spectrum
preserving actions β and α of M and L respectively; thus E is continuous-trace with
spectrum X × Td−1. We assume that that the H3 ﬂux component of E vanishes, then X
these conditions, for instance). The T-dual boundary algebra is then bE = IndV
is stably equivalent to C0(X,K) (the continuous-trace algebras used in Section 4 satisfy
M(X , β) (cid:111)
V (cid:27) (X (cid:111)β M) ⊗ K(L2(V /M)). The bulk algebra is
L(E, α) (cid:27) IndW

N (X , α × β),

B = IndU

and, with (α × β)(n) = ad(ρ(n)) locally, we ﬁnd Mackey obstructions σ = {σx} which
corresponds to an H1 component of ﬂux. The T-dual bulk algebra is now

bB (cid:27) (bE (cid:111)α L) ⊗ K (cid:27) (X (cid:111)α×β N) ⊗ K,

and that is Morita equivalent to the sections of a bundle of twisted group C∗-algebras
C∗(N, σx) over X (see also Sect. 5.1.1).
The basic example of B = T3 = S1 × T2, with Dixmier–Douady invariant the volume
form, was considered in detail in [18]. In this case, we have X = S1, U (cid:27) V (cid:27) R and
L (cid:27) M (cid:27) Z. The boundary algebra E has spectrum E = S1 × T = T2, and there can be
equivalent to C(T2). The T-dual bulk algebra bB is Morita equivalent to the group C∗-
no Dixmier–Douady obstruction, since the dimension is less than 3, so it will be Morita
noncommutative tori over S1. The T-dual boundary algebra bE is the group C∗-algebra

algebra of a discrete Heisenberg group, which can be viewed geometrically as a bundle of

of a Z2 subgroup of the Heisenberg group, and is isomorphic to the algebra of functions
on a 2-torus dual to T2.

Section outline: Sect. 5.1 contains some generalities about multipliers on Zd and
Rd and their relationship to (abstract) Heisenberg groups. It may be skipped to to get
directly to Sect. 5.2, which deals with concrete generalizations of the above basic example
to higher-dimensions. A new analogous example involving the solvable group is then given
in 5.3.

5.1 Universal Heisenberg groups and algebras
As in [18], we note that the principal role of X here is to parametrise the U(1)-valued
multipliers (or 2-cocycles) of N. Now the cohomology class [σ] ∈ H2(G, T) of a single

15

multiplier σ on a separable locally compact abelian group G, is characterised by the

antisymmetric bicharactereσ(g1, g2) = σ(g1, g2)/σ(g2, g1), [23, 15]. Note that if σ is already
an antisymmetric bicharacter, then eσ = σ2.
For a vector group W we can write the bicharacter as eσ = exp(2πis), where s is a skew
symmetric bilinear form, which can be thought of as a linear functional s ∈ ∧2cW on the
antisymmetric tensors ∧2W such that s(w1∧w2) = s(w1, w2) ∈ R; thus H2(W, T) (cid:27) ∧2cW.
Each class [σ] ∈ H2(W, T) has a representative multiplier eσ
1
2 = exp(πis) which is also
an antisymmetric bicharacter, corresponding to the skew-symmetric form (w1, w2) 7→
2s(w1, w2).
1
The Schur multiplier (or Moore representation group) is a “universal” central exten-
sion, from which all others can be obtained, which in this case is a central extension of
W by ∧2W, given by the exact sequence

1 −→ ∧2W −→ Heis(W) −→ W −→ 1.

(16)
It is a generalised (real) Heisenberg group, Heis(W) = W × ∧2W whose product can be
given explicitly as

(w1, p1) · (w2, p2) = (w1 + w2, p1 + p2 + w1 ∧ w2).

Each s ∈ ∧2cW determines a central extension Heiss(W) of W by R: take W × R with

product

(w1, p1) · (w2, p2) = (w1 + w2, p1 + p2 + s(w1 ∧ w2)),

Wi ∈ W, pj ∈ R.

Let Ks be the kernel of s. The following commutative diagram with exact rows and
columns (for non-zero s) shows how this relates to (16):

Although ks and s deﬁne diﬀerent group extensions, up to isomorphism Heiss(W) is
independent of which non-zero multiple of s has been chosen. If we took ks instead of
s, then the map (w, p) 7→ (w, kp) gives an isomorphism of Heiss(W) and Heisks(W) as
groups.
group N ⊂ W are parametrised by the antisymmetric bicharactereσ(n, n0) = σ(n, n0)/σ(n0, n),
and we can write eσ = exp(2πis) for some skew-symmetric s ∈ ∧2cW as before. Those s
they form a lattice (∧2N)⊥ in ∧2cW, so we have H2(N, T) (cid:27) ∧2cW /(∧2N)⊥ (cid:27) ∧2cN.
which restrict to integer-valued forms on ∧2N ⊂ ∧2W give trivial multipliers for N, and

Just as for vector groups W, the cohomology classes [σ] of multipliers for the lattice

The central extensions of N by Z are classiﬁed by H2(N, Z) (cid:27) (∧2N)⊥, and a coho-
mology class can be labelled by a homomorphism s : ∧2N → Z. Unlike the vector group
case, s need not be surjective onto Z. For example, s and ks have the same kernel Ks
for any 0 (cid:44) k ∈ Z, but they have diﬀerent images in Z. This has consequences for the
resulting group extensions Heiss(N), which are deﬁned as the central extensions

As an example, take N = Zd × Zd and we write n = (a, b) ∈ Zd × Zd. The standard
integer Heisenberg group Heiss0(N) is given by s0((a1, b1), (a2, b2)) = a1 · b2 ∈ Z. It has a
faithful representation, the standard representation, given by

For a non-zero integer k, the central extension Heisks0(N) is not isomorphic as a group
to Heiss0(N). But if we rescale to

1 −→ k−1Z −→ k−1Heisks0(N) −→ k−1N −→ 1,

there is an isomorphism ψk : Heiss0(N) → k−1Heisks0(N) given by ψk(n, c) = (k−1n, k−1c),

where the centre is now k−2Z since s0 : ∧2(k−1N) → k−2Z. Then we also have Heiss0(N) (cid:27)
Heiss0(k−1N), with isomorphism φk given by φk(n, c) = (k−1n, k−2c).

We have therefore proved the following:

Theorem 5.2. With the above notation we have isomorphisms

Heiss0(k−1N) (cid:27) Heiss0(N) (cid:27) k−1Heisks0(N).

From this we deduce that Heisks0(N) is isomorphic to kHeiss0(k−1N), whose elements
are k(k−1n, k−2c) = (n, k−1c). This enables us to construct a matrix representation of
Heisks0(Z2d) [18], from the standard representation π of Heiss0(Z2d): writing n = (a, b) ∈
Zd × Zd and s0((a1, b1), (a2, b2)) = a1 · b2 as before, we obtain the faithful representation

With the concrete realizations (19)-(20), it is easy to see that there is an exact sequence

1 −→ Heiss0(N) −→ Heisks0(N) −→ Zk −→ 1.

5.2 Heisenberg groups, nilmanifolds, and T-duality
The standard integer (matrix) Heisenberg group HeisZ(2d), d ∈ Z+, comprises the upper
triangular matrices

which has the multiplication law (a1, b1, c1)·(a2, b2, c2) = (a1 + a2, b1 + b2, c1 + c2 + a1 · b2)
(this is Heiss0(Z2d) of Sect. 5.1). It is a subgroup of HeisR(2d) deﬁned by the same formula
but with a, b ∈ Rd, c ∈ R. Both matrix Heisenberg groups are central extensions,

1 −→ R −→ HeisR(2d) −→ R2d −→ 1,
1 −→ Z −→ HeisZ(2d) −→ Z2d −→ 1.

Let W = R2d with w ∈ W identiﬁed with (a, b) ∈ Rd × Rd, and let ω(w1, w2) =
a1 · b2 − a2 · b1 be the standard symplectic form on W. We can also deﬁne the real
Heisenberg group HeisR(W, ω) as the set W × R equipped with the product
(w1, p1) · (w2, p2) = (w1 + w2, p1 + p2 + 1

pi ∈ R, wi ∈ W, i = 1, 2.

This is a special case of a more general construction given in Sect. 5.1. The groups
HeisR(2d) and HeisR(W, ω) can be identiﬁed by
HeisR(2d) 3 (a, b, c) ←→ ((a, b), c − 1
We shall use this identiﬁcation in what follows.
Take a one-dimensional subspace U ⊂ W and V a complementary subspace R2d−1.
We can regard U as a subgroup of HeisR(W, ω) by u ↔ (0, u). The restricted symplectic
(preimage) eV of V in HeisR(2d) is a normal subgroup isomorphic to HeisR(2(d − 1)) × R,
form ω| (cid:66) ω|V ×V is non-degenerate only on a 2(d−1) dimensional subspace of V . The lift
and we can exhibit HeisR(2d) as a semi-direct product HeisR(2d) (cid:27) eV (cid:111) U. With L and
M the standard lattices in U and V respectively, we also have HeisZ(2d) (cid:27) fM (cid:111) L, where
fM (cid:27) HeisZ(2(d − 1)) × Z is the lift of M. In particular, we can write C∗(HeisZ(2d)) (cid:27)
C∗(fM) (cid:111) L and obtain its associated PV-boundary map
The quotient eV /fM = Nil(2(d−1))× T is a classifying space BfM, and there is a ﬁbration

∂ : K•(C∗(HeisZ(2d))) → K•+1(C∗(fM)).

of HeisR(2d)/HeisZ(2d) = Nil(2d) = BHeisZ(2d) over T = BZ (in fact a ﬁbre bundle),

Nil(2(d − 1)) × T ι−−→ Nil(2d) −→ T.

For k ∈ Z, k (cid:44) 0, we can use the symplectic form kω instead of ω, to obtain the modiﬁed
integer Heisenberg groups HeisZ(2d, k) and nilmanifolds Nilk(2d) = HeisR(2d)/HeisZ(2d, k).
Consider CT(S1×T2d, dθ∧kω) where ω is the standard symplectic form on T2d = W/N
(lifting to ω on W = R2d as deﬁned earlier), and dθ is the usual 1-form on S1. The ﬂux
dθ ∧ kω is of H1 type, and by the same arguments for the d = 1 case in [27], the T-dual
of CT(S1 × T2d, dθ ∧ kω) with respect to T2d is C∗(HeisZ(2d, k)). In more detail, we can
obtain

CT(S1 × T2d, dθ ∧ kω) (cid:27) IndW

N (C(S1,K), γ),

as in Corollary 4.3, where above each x ∈ S1, there is a projective representation νx of N
with multiplier σx, and γ = Ad(νx). Then the T-dual is a bundle over S1 of twisted group
C∗-algebras C∗(N, σx), which is what we obtain when we decompose C∗(HeisZ(2d, k))
into a twisted crossed product C∗(Z) (cid:111)σ N (see also Sect. 5.1.1). Similarly, the restriction
to M. Its T-dual with respect to T2d−1 is (C∗(HeisZ(2(d − 1, k))) ⊗ C∗(Z)) (cid:27) C∗(fM) —
CT(S1 × T2d−1, dθ ∧ kω|) where T2d−1 = V /M is induced from C(S1,K) by γ restricted
note that the ω|-complement of T2d−1, which is a circle T, does not see any ﬂux so it
T-dualizes to the C∗(Z) factor.
On the other hand, as an S1 bundle over T2d with ﬂux dθ ∧ kω (now of purely H2
type), the T-dual of CT(S1 × T2d, dθ ∧ kω) is Nilk(2d), a principal circle bundle over
CT(S1 × T2d−1, dθ ∧ kω|) is Nilk(2(d − 1)) × T) = eV /fM, where Nilk(2(d − 1)) has Chern
T2d with Chern class represented by kω. Similarly, the T-dual with respect to S1 of
class supported on the subtorus T2(d−1) on which ω| is non-degenerate (this subtorus is
the base of Nilk(2(d − 1))), while the extra T just goes along for the ride.

The nilmanifold Nilk(2d) has an action of HeisR(2d) and the symmetric imprimitivity

theorem [40] gives a strong Morita equivalence
C(Nilk(2d)) (cid:111) HeisR(2d) ∼ C(HeisR(2d)\HeisR(2d)) (cid:111) HeisZ(2d, k) = C∗(HeisZ(2d, k)),

20

which together with the generalization of the Connes–Thom isomorphism Theorem to
HeisR(2d) ([6], [12]), gives “non-abelian T-duality” (c.f. Section 3.3 of [18])

K−•(Nilk(2d)) = K•(C(Nilk(2d))) THeisR(2d)(cid:27) K•+1(C∗(HeisZ(2d, k))).

Similarly, we have

K−•(Nilk(2(d − 1)) × T) THeisR(2(d−1))×R

(cid:27)

K•(C∗(HeisZ(2(d − 1), k)) ⊗ C∗(Z)).

With the above deﬁnitions, we have the following commutative diagram, which is a

higher-dimensional generalization of Proposition 3.3 in [18],

5.3 Solvable groups, solvmanifolds, and T-duality
Recall (cf. [45]) that the real simply-connected 3 dimensional Solvable group SolR is
deﬁned as a split R2-extension of R,

1 −→ R2 −→ SolR −→ R −→ 1

where R acts on R2 by

(t, (x, y)) 7→ (etx, e−ty),

that is, t ∈ R acts on R2 as the SL(2, R) matrix

If SolR is identiﬁed with R3 so that (x, y) are the coordinates on the R2-normal subgroup,
then the product is given by

(x, y, t).(x0, y0, t0) = (x + e−tx0, y + ety0, t + t0).

Then (0, 0, 0) is the identity in SolR. The inverse of (x, y, t) is (−etx,−e−ty,−t), and one
sees that the left invariant 1-forms on SolR are τ1 = e−tdx, τ2 = −etdy and τ3 = dt. We
compute that dτ1 = −dt ∧ τ1, dτ2 = dt ∧ τ2, and dτ3 = 0.

Now a general left invariant 2-form B on SolR is given by
2τ tΘτ

X Θij τi ∧ τj = 1

B = 1

where τ is the column vector with j-th componet τj, τ t is the transpose of τ and Θ a
skew-symmetric (3×3) matrix. By the computations above, dB = 0, that is B is a closed
left invariant 2-form on SolR. A left invariant Riemannian metric is given by

ds2 = e2tdx2 + e−2tdy2 + dt2.

We next recall the construction of lattices in SolR and we follow [1] closely, see also
[26]. Let K = Q(d) be a real quadratic ﬁeld and let ι1, ι2 : K → R, be its two real
embeddings. Denote by L ⊂ K a lattice, with U +
L the group of totally positive units
preserving L,

L = {u ∈ O∗
U +

K : ιj(u) ∈ R∗

+, for j = 1, 2, uL ⊂ L}.

Denote by A a generator, so that U +
In the example where
L = OK is the ring of integers of K, then the generator A is a fundamental unit. Consider
the embedding of L in R2 given by the mapping

L = AZ = {An : n ∈ Z}.

L 3 ‘ −→ (ι1(‘), ι2(‘)) ∈ R2.

Let Λ = (ι1, ι2)(L). It is a lattice in R2, and U +

L acts on Λ by
(ι1(‘), ι2(‘)) −→ (Aι1(‘), A−1ι2(‘)).

Denote by V the group U +

L ; then V (cid:27) Z. Consider the semi direct product

SolZ(A) = Λ (cid:111)A V

where the action of V = AZ on Λ is induced by the action by multiplication on L. As
shown in [1], these are all lattices in the solvable Lie group SolR.

The homogeneous space

inclusion of the ﬁbre torus ι : T2 ,→ SolvA induces a restriction map ι∗. Similarly, the

6 Bulk-boundary correspondence for higher dimen-

tors with disorder

sional analogue of the quantum Hall eﬀect and topological insulators, generalizing the

action on the base may not lift to the total space, but does lift to an R-action.
Now assume that α is a Zd action on A, and write α| for the restricted Zd−1-action.
Then A(cid:111)α Zn is an d-fold iterated crossed product by Z, and in particular, (A(cid:111)α| Zd−1)(cid:111)Z.

Specializing to the case when A = C(Σ), where Σ is a compact Cantor set with
an action of Zd, we get precisely the higher dimensional analog of Example 4, section
4.6 in [29], generalizing the phenomenon that T-duality trivialises the bulk-boundary
correspondence in the disordered case in 2D.
Now let A be a real C∗-algebra with a Zd-action α. Since the real version of Paschke’s
map [32] is also, up to a sign convention, the Connes–Thom isomorphism [6] composed
with an isomorphism from Green’s imprimitivity theorem, it follows that the real version
of the diagram above also commutes.

Here, Td is the character space of Zd with involution inherited from complex conjugation,

The physical relevance of the commutative diagrams in this section is that a Zd action
on A = C(Ω) is often used to model disorder with disorder probability space Ω (e.g.
[34]). The twisting by Θ is a fundamental feature of the magnetic translations in the
integer quantum Hall eﬀect and its higher dimensional generalizations. Both disorder
and twisting are crucial ingredients needed to explain phenomena like plateau in the
Hall conductivity [3]. In the real case (24) says, for example, that the bulk-boundary
homomorphism for time-reversal symmetric topological insulators is again trivialized into
the geometric restriction map under real T-duality, even in the presence of disorder. This
generalizes our earlier computations in [29].

A Appendix: Paschke’s map and the Connes–Thom

isomorphism

This appendix explains why Paschke’s map [32] is, up to a sign convention, the Connes–
Thom isomorphism [6] composed with an isomorphism from Green’s imprimitivity the-
orem. This result belongs to a family of ideas which can be found in [6, 7, 8, 32] and
may be known to experts, but we provide a detailed argument for the reader’s reference.
The Paschke map is explicitly deﬁned for each Z-algebra (A, α), whereas the Connes–
Thom map is more abstractly deﬁned. As we will see, there is an analogous abstract
characterization of the Paschke map, which determines its formula uniquely.

Generalities on Connes–Thom isomorphism
Recall from [6] that the Connes–Thom isomorphism is a natural transformation between
the functors K•(·) and K•+1((·) (cid:111) R), • ∈ Z2, i.e. it assigns to every R-C∗-algebra (A , α)
α : K•(A ) → K•+1(A (cid:111)α R), such that for any morphism ρ : (A , α) →
an isomorphism φ•
(B, β), the following diagram commutes:

α

φ•

β

/ K•+1(A (cid:111)α R)
(ρ(cid:111)R)∗
/ K•+1(B (cid:111)β R)

(25)

Here, ρ (cid:111) R is the morphism of crossed products induced by the equivariant map ρ.
Furthermore, Connes shows that φ•
α is an isomorphism which is determined uniquely by
this naturality property together with a normalization condition (for (A, α) = (C, id))
and compatibility with suspensions.

The analogous axioms for Paschke’s map
If ρ : (A, α) → (B, β) is a morphism of Z-C∗-algebras (not necessarily unital), the in-
Z(·) gives a morphism of induced algebras ˜ρ : Ind(A, α) →
duction functor Ind (cid:66) IndR
Ind(B, β) which is equivariant for the respective translation actions τ α, τ β of R. Elements
of Ind(A, α) are viewed either as bounded continuous functions f : R → A satisfy-
ing an equivariance condition3, f(x + 1) = α(f(x)), x ∈ R, or alternatively, continuous
f : [0, 1] → A such that f(1) = α(f(0)) (the mapping torus). The translation action τ α
of R on Ind(A, α) is (τ α
Let Sα be the suspended Z-action on SA (acting by α on A and trivially on the
suspension variable). Note that S(Ind(A, α)) (cid:27) Ind(SA, Sα) and S(A (cid:111)α Z) (cid:27) SA (cid:111)Sα Z,
and write S•
For • ∈ Z2, let γ• be a natural transformation of the functors (A, α) 7→ K•(Ind(A, α))
and (A, α) 7→ K•+1(A (cid:111)α Z) from Z-algebras to abelian groups, satisfying the following
three axioms:

(·) for the natural suspension isomorphisms K•(·) → K•−1(S(·)).

t f)(s) = f(s + t), s, t ∈ R.

3We have switched convention for induced algebras in the Appendix compared to the main text. This

is to make closer contact to Paschke’s original work, and the eﬀect is that α−1 is replaced by α.

Proposition A.4. There is a unique γ satisfying Axioms A.1-A.3.
Proof. Outline: We use a modiﬁcation of Connes’ argument for the uniqueness of φ.
Axiom A.3 and Bott periodicity ensures that we only need to look at γ0 (which we will
simply denote by γ subsequently). We need to show that γα[p] ∈ K1(A (cid:111)α Z) is uniquely
determined for any projection p ≡ {pθ}θ∈[0,1] in Ind(A, α). The basic idea is to construct
a Z-action α0, exterior equivalent to α, which ﬁxes p0. Furthermore the new induced
algebra Ind(A, α0), with its translation action τ α0, is R-equivariantly isomorphic to the
original IndαA with a modiﬁed action τ0, where τ0 is exterior equivalent to the original
τ α and ﬁxes p. Thus the projection p0 ∈ Ind(A, α0) corresponding to p ∈ Ind(A, α) under
this isomorphism is itself translation invariant under τ α0. Then the Axioms determine
what γα0[p0] has to be. Finally we need to argue that the modiﬁcation α 7→ α0 can be
assumed because the above exterior equivalences determine unique maps, consistent with
the Axioms, which yield the desired γα[p] from γα0[p0].
Details: As in [6], we may assume without loss that A is unital and p ∈ Ind(A, α).
By [6] Prop. 4 (c.f. [8] Lemma 10.16, [39]), we may also assume that on Ind(A, α) there
is an action R-action τ0, exterior equivalent to τ α, which ﬁxes p. Let U ≡ {Ut}t∈R be
t . Thus {Ut}t∈R
the 1-cocycle on Ind(A, α) which relates τ α and τ0 via τ0
satisﬁes the cocycle condition and equivariance condition,
Ut(1) = α(Ut(0)),

t = Ad(Ut) ◦ τ α

We can verify, from (28), that the assignment u : n 7→ Un(0) (cid:67) un, n ∈ Z deﬁnes a
unitary 1-cocycle {un}n∈Z on (A, α), i.e., um+n = umαm(un). Thus A (cid:111)α0 Z (cid:27) A (cid:111)α Z (a
canonical isomorphism ϕu is given in Lemma A.5 later).
1 = Ad(U1) ◦ τ α1 ﬁxes p, it follows that p0 (cid:66) p(0) ∈ A ﬁxed by α0. Deﬁne the
isomorphism ΨU : Ind(A, α) → Ind(A, α0) by
ΨU f(s) = Ad(Us(0))[f(s)],

s ∈ R, f ∈ Ind(A, α).

We can verify that ΨU f does satisfy α0-equivariance, and intertwines τ0 on Ind(A, α) with
the new translation action τ α0 on Ind(A, α0), i.e. (τ α0

t (ΨU f)) = (ΨU(τ0

tf)).

Observe that p0(θ) = p0

0 = p0 since p0 = ΨU(p) is ﬁxed by τ α0. The homomorphism
ω : (C, id) → (A, α0),

is Z-equivariant, and we write ˜ω for the corresponding inﬂated map ˜ω : C(T) (cid:27) Ind(C, id) →
Ind(A, α0). Note that

(˜ω(1C(T)))(θ) ≡ ω(1C(T)(θ)) = p0

0 = p0(θ),

θ ∈ [0, 1],

so p0 = ˜ω(1C(T)). Then naturality and normalization means that γα0[p0] must be deter-
mined by the equation

γα0[p0] = γα0 ◦ ˜ω∗[1C(T)] = (ω (cid:111) Z)∗ ◦ γid[1C(T)] = (ω (cid:111) Z)∗[b].

Paschke’s unitaries and Connes’ cocycle
Given a p ∈ Ind(A, α), we may start from Connes’ cocycle {Ut}t∈R in (28) above, and
obtain a path of unitaries wθ (cid:66) U∗
θ (p(0)) = (Ad(U∗

θ (0), θ ∈ [0, 1] in A. Then w0 = 1 and
θ ) ◦ τ0(p))(0) = Ad(U∗

θ (0))(p(0)) = Ad(wθ)(p0),

pθ = p(θ) = τ α

thus {wθ}θ∈[0,1] is precisely a Paschke path whose existence was proved in [32].
Conversely, given a Paschke path {wθ}θ∈[0,1] such that w0 = 1 and Ad(wθ)(p0) = pθ,
we can reconstruct Connes’ cocycle for the action τ α on Ind(A, α) as follows. Regard
p ∈ Ind(A, α) as a projection-valued function R → A through the equivariance condition
p(s) ≡ ps = α(ps−1), s ∈ R. Similarly, extend Paschke’s w : [1, 0] 7→ A to a continuous
unitary function w : R 3 s 7→ ws ∈ A by the recursion relation ws = α(ws−1) · w1. It is
easy to check that ps = Ad(ws)(p0) for all s ∈ R, and that n 7→ wn deﬁnes a 1-cocycle
for (A, α). The projection p0 is then ﬁxed by α0

homomorphism ω (and thus ω (cid:111) Z) is non-unital in general, so the induced map (ω (cid:111) Z)∗
in K1 is slightly tricky to compute (c.f. Prop. 8.1.6 of [41]). Namely, we have to append
a formal unit 1 to C(T) and A (cid:111)α0 Z, replace [b] by [1 − 1C(T) + b], then compute (ω (cid:111) Z)∗
using the unital extension (ω (cid:111) Z)+ : C(T)+ → (A (cid:111)α0 Z)+. This gives

α0 ◦(ΨU)∗[p] = γ0

α[p] = (ϕ−1

The real case
A general reference for the K-theory of real C∗-algebras is [44]. The Connes–Thom
isomorphisms and Pimsner–Voiculescu exact sequence also hold for real C∗-algebras A
still makes sense
and real crossed products, see [43, 44]. Similarly, Paschke’s map γ0,Paschke
on real Z-algebras (A, α). We can then repeat the arguments in this appendix to obtain
the real version of Theorem A.8. The only signiﬁcant change is in the normalization

axiom, and in taking • ∈ Z8 rather than in Z2.
inherited from complex conjugation of characters (parametrised by θ ∈ [0, 1]), and C(T; ς)
is the real C∗-algebra of continuous functions f ∈ T → C such that f(θ) = f(−θ). These
functions are precisely the ones with real Fourier coeﬃcients. It is known (pp. 40 of [44])
that K1(C(T; ς)) (cid:27) Z[z]⊕Z2[−1C(T,ς)], where z denotes the unitary function θ 7→ e2πiθ with
winding number 1. Furthermore, [z] is the Bott element implementing (1,1) periodicity
in KR-theory (c.f. Theorem 1.5.4 of [44], Theorem 10.3 of [24]), so we also write it as
[br]. We can also identify it with the unitary L implementing the (trivial) automorphism
in R (cid:111)id Z.

Recall that C (cid:111)id Z = C∗

On the other hand, the induced algebra for (R, id) is just the continuous real-valued

functions on the circle C(T; R). It is also known that
