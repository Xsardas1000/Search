Abstract

We propose a Bayesian model of unsuper-
vised semantic role induction in multiple
languages, and use it to explore the useful-
ness of parallel corpora for this task. Our
joint Bayesian model consists of individ-
ual models for each language plus addi-
tional latent variables that capture align-
ments between roles across languages.
Because it is a generative Bayesian model,
we can do evaluations in a variety of sce-
narios just by varying the inference proce-
dure, without changing the model, thereby
comparing the scenarios directly. We com-
pare using only monolingual data, using
a parallel corpus, using a parallel corpus
with annotations in the other language,
and using small amounts of annotation
in the target language. We ﬁnd that the
biggest impact of adding a parallel cor-
pus to training is actually the increase in
mono-lingual data, with the alignments to
another language resulting in small im-
provements, even with labeled data for the
other language.
Introduction

1
Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has emerged as
an important task in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) due to its applicability in information ex-
traction, question answering, and other NLP tasks.
SRL is the problem of ﬁnding predicate-argument
structure in a sentence, as illustrated below:
[A0 Mike ] has [P RED written ][A1 a book ]

(S1)

Here, the predicate WRITE has two arguments:
‘Mike’ as A0 or the writer, and ‘a book’ as A1 or
the thing written. The labels A0 and A1 correspond
to the PropBank annotations (Palmer et al., 2005).
As the need for SRL arises in different domains
and languages, the existing manually annotated

corpora become insufﬁcient to build supervised
systems. This has motivated work on unsuper-
vised SRL (Lang and Lapata, 2011b; Titov and
Klementiev, 2012a; Garg and Henderson, 2012).
Previous work has indicated that unsupervised
systems could beneﬁt from the word alignment in-
formation in parallel text in two or more languages
(Naseem et al., 2009; Snyder et al., 2009; Titov
and Klementiev, 2012b). For example, consider
the German translation of sentence S1:
[A0Mike] hat [A1ein Buch][P REDgeschrieben]
If sentences S1 and S2 have the word alignments:
Mike-Mike, written-geschrieben, and book-Buch,
the system might be able to predict A1 for Buch,
even if there is insufﬁcient information in the
monolingual German data to learn this assign-
ment. Thus, in languages where the resources are
sparse or not good enough, or the distributions are
not informative, SRL systems could be made more
accurate by using parallel data with resource rich
or more amenable languages.

(S2)

In this paper, we propose a joint Bayesian
model for unsupervised semantic role induction
in multiple languages. The model consists of
individual Bayesian models for each language
(Garg and Henderson, 2012), and crosslingual la-
tent variables to incorporate soft role agreement
between aligned constituents. This latent vari-
able approach has been demonstrated to increase
the performance in a multilingual unsupervised
part-of-speech tagging model based on HMMs
(Naseem et al., 2009). We investigate the appli-
cation of this approach to unsupervised SRL, pre-
senting the performance improvements obtained
in different settings involving labeled and unla-
beled data, and analyzing the annotation effort re-
quired to obtain similar gains using labeled data.
We begin by brieﬂy describing the unsupervised
SRL pipeline and the monolingual semantic role
induction model we use, and then describe our
multilingual model.

2 Unsupervised SRL Pipeline
As established in previous work (Gildea and Juraf-
sky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005), we use a standard
unsupervised SRL setup, consisting of the follow-
ing steps:
1. Syntactic Parsing Off-the-shelf parsers can be
used to syntactically parse a given sentence. We
use a dependency parse because of its simplicity
and easier comparison with the previous work in
unsupervised SRL.
2. Predicate Identiﬁcation We select all the non-
auxiliary verbs in a sentence as predicates.
3. Argument Identiﬁcation For a given predi-
cate, this step classiﬁes each constituent of the
parse tree as a semantic argument or a non-
argument. Heuristics based on syntactic features
such as the dependency relation of a constituent
to its head, path from the constituent to the pred-
icate, etc. have been used in unsupervised SRL.
4. Argument Classiﬁcation Without access
to
semantic role labels, unsupervised SRL systems
cast the problem as a clustering problem. Argu-
ments of a predicate in all the sentences are di-
vided into clusters such that each cluster corre-
sponds to a single semantic role. The better this
clustering is, the easier it becomes for a human
to give it an actual semantic role label like A0,
A1, etc. Our model assigns a role variable to ev-
ery identiﬁed argument. This variable can take
any value from 1 to N, where N is the number of
semantic roles that we want to induce.

The task we model, unsupervised semantic role in-
duction, is the step 4 of this pipeline.

3 Monolingual Model
We use the Bayesian model of Garg and Hender-
son (2012) as our base monolingual model. The
semantic roles are predicate-speciﬁc. To model
the role ordering and repetition preferences, the
role inventory for each predicate is divided into
Primary and Secondary roles as follows:
Primary Role (PR) Let there be a total of N
roles (or clusters) for each predicate. Assign K
of them as PRs {P1, P2, ..., PK}. Further, create 3
additional PRs: ST ART denoting the start of the
role sequence, EN D denoting its end, and P RED
denoting the predicate. These (K + 3) PRs are
not allowed to repeat in a frame and their order-
ing deﬁnes the global role ordering.

Secondary Role (SR) The rest of the (N − K)
roles are called SRs {S1, S2, ..., SN−K}. Unlike
PRs, they are not constrained to occur only once
and only their ordering w.r.t. PRs is used in the
probability model.

For example, the complete role sequence in a
frame could be: (ST ART , P3, S1, S1, P RED, P2, S5,
EN D). The ordering is deﬁned as the sequence of
PRs, (ST ART , P3, P RED, P2, EN D). Each pair of
consecutive PRs in an ordering is called an inter-
val. Thus, (P3, P RED) is an interval that contains
two SRs, S1 and S1. An interval could also be
empty, for instance (ST ART, P3) contains no SRs.
When we evaluate, these roles get mapped to gold
roles. For instance, the PR P2 could get mapped to
a core role like A0, A1, etc. or to a modiﬁer role like
AM − T M P , AM − M OD, etc. Garg and Henderson
(2012) reported that, in practice, PRs mostly get
mapped to core roles and SRs to modiﬁer roles,
which conforms to the linguistic motivations for
this distinction.

Figure 4 illustrates two copies of the monolin-
gual model, on either side of the crosslingual latent
variables. The generative process is as follows:
1. Predicate, Voice The predicate p and its voice
vc are treated as top-level visible variables.
2. Ordering (Generate PRs) Select an ordered
set of PRs from a multinomial distribution.
o ∼ M ultinomial(θorder
p,vc )
3. Generate SRs For each interval in the ordering
o, a sequence of SRs is generated as:
for each interval I ∈ o:
draw an indicator s ∼ Binomial(θST OP
p,I,0 )
while s (cid:54)= ST OP:
choose a SR r ∼ M ultinomial(θSR
p,I )
draw an indicator s ∼ Binomial(θST OP
p,I,1 )

4. Generate Features For each PR and SR, the
features for that constituent are generated inde-
pendently. To keep the model simple and com-
parable to previous unsupervised work, we only
use three features: (i) dependency relation of the
argument to its head, (ii) head word of the argu-
ment, and (iii) POS tag of the head word:
for each generated role r:
for each feature type f:
choose a value vf ∼ M ultinomial(θF
All the multinomial and binomial distributions
have symmetric Dirichlet and beta priors respec-
tively. Figure 1a gives the probability equations

for the monolingual model. This formulation
models the global role ordering and repetition
preferences using PRs, and limited context for SRs
using intervals. Ordering and repetition informa-
tion was found to be helpful in supervised SRL
as well (Punyakanok et al., 2004; Pradhan et al.,
2005; Toutanova et al., 2008). More details, in-
cluding the motivations behind this model, are in
(Garg and Henderson, 2012).

4 Multilingual Model

The multilingual model uses word alignments be-
tween sentences in a parallel corpus to exploit
role correspondences across languages. We make
copies of the monolingual model for each lan-
guage and add additional crosslingual latent vari-
ables (CLVs) to couple the monolingual mod-
els, capturing crosslingual semantic role patterns.
Concretely, when training on parallel sentences,
whenever the head words of the arguments are
aligned, we add a CLV as a parent of the two cor-
responding role variables. Figure 4 illustrates this
model. The generative process, as explained be-
low, remains the same as the monolingual model
for the most part, with the exception of aligned

roles which are now generated by both the mono-
lingual process as well as the CLV.
1. Monolingual Data Given a parallel frame with
the predicate pair p1, p2, generate two separate
monolingual frames as in section 3.
2. Aligned Arguments For each aligned argu-
ment, ﬁrst generate a crosslingual latent variable
from a Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). Then
generate the two aligned roles:
for aligned arguments i, j:
draw a crosslingual latent variable:

draw role for language l1:

z ∼ CRP (αCRP
p1,p2)
ri ∼ M ultinomial(θalign
rj ∼ M ultinomial(θalign

draw role for language l2:

p1,p2,z,l1)

p1,p2,z,l2)

Every predicate-tuple has its own inventory of
CLVs speciﬁc to that tuple. Each CLV z is a multi-
valued variable where each value deﬁnes a distri-
bution over role labels for each language (denoted
by θalign
p1,p2,z,l above). These distributions over la-
bels are trained to be peaky, so that each value c
for a CLV represents a correlation between the la-
bels that c predicts in the two languages. For ex-

Figure 4: Multilingual model. The CLVs and their associated parameters are drawn in bold. P R3 in
language 1 is aligned to P R3 in language 2 with the corresponding CLV taking the value c2, and SRM is
aligned to P R2 with the CLV taking the value c7.

ample, a value c for the CLV z might give high
probabilities to S3 and S8 in language 1, and to
S1 in language 2. If c is the only value for z that
gives high probability to S3 in language 1, and the
monolingual model in language 1 decides to as-
sign S3 to the role for z, then z will predict S1 in
language 2, with high probability. We generate the
CLVs via a Chinese Restaurant Process (Pitman,
2002), a non-parametric Bayesian model, which
allows us to induce the number of CLVs for every
predicate-tuple from the data. We continue to train
on the non-parallel sentences using the respective
monolingual models.

The multilingual model is deﬁcient, since the
aligned roles are being generated twice. Ideally,
we would like to add the CLV as additional condi-
tioning variables in the monolingual models. The
new joint probability can be written as equation
5 (Figure 2a), which can be further decomposed
following the decomposition of the monolingual
model in Figure 1a. However, having this addi-
tional conditioning variable breaks the Dirichlet-
multinomial conjugacy, which makes it intractable
to marginalize out the parameters during infer-
ence. Hence, we use an approximation where we
treat each of the aligned roles as being generated
twice, once by the monolingual model and once
by the corresponding CLV (equation 6).

This is the ﬁrst work to incorporate the cou-
pling of aligned arguments directly in a Bayesian
SRL model. This makes it easier to see how to
extend this model in a principled way to incor-
porate additional sources of information. First,
the model scales gracefully to more than two lan-
guages.
If there are a total of n languages, and
there is an aligned argument in m of them, the

multilingual latent variable is connected to only
those m aligned arguments.

Second, having one joint Bayesian model al-
lows us to use the same model in various semi-
supervised learning settings,
just by ﬁxing the
annotated variables during training. Section 6.6
evaluates a setting where we have some labeled
data in one language (called source), while no la-
beled data in the second language (called target).
Note that this is different from a classic annotation
projection setting (e.g. (Pad´o and Lapata, 2009)),
where the role labels are mapped from source con-
stituents to aligned target constituents.

Inference and Training

The inference problem consists of predicting the
role labels and CLVs (the hidden variables) given
the predicate, its voice, and syntactic features of
all the identiﬁed arguments (the visible variables).
We use a collapsed Gibbs-sampling based ap-
proach to generate samples for the hidden vari-
ables (model parameters are integrated out). The
sample counts and the priors are then used to cal-
culate the MAP estimate of the model parameters.
For the monolingual model, the role at a given

position is sampled as:
P (ri|r−i,f ,p,vc,D−)∝P (ri,r−i,f|p,vc,D−)

=(cid:82) P (ri,r−i,f|θ,p,vc)P (θ|D−)dθ
where the subscript −i refers to all the variables
except at position i, D− refers to the variables in
all the training instances except the current one,
and θ refers to all the model parameters. The
above integral has a closed form solution due to
Dirichlet-multinomial conjugacy.

For sampling roles in the multilingual model,
we also need to consider the probabilities of roles
being generated by the CLVs:
P (ri|r−i,f ,p,vc,z,D−)∝P (ri,r−i,f|z,p,vc,D−)

=(cid:82) P (ri,r−i,f|θ,z,p,vc)P (θ|D−)dθ
=(cid:82) P (ri,r−i,f|θ,p,vc)((cid:81) P (rj|θ,zk)

)P (θ|D−)dθ

j,k:zk→rj

For sampling CLVs, we need to consider three
factors: two corresponding to probabilities of gen-
erating the aligned roles, and the third one corre-
sponding to selecting the CLV according to CRP.

P (zk|rl1

i ,rl2

j ,D−,k)∝P (rl1

i |zk,D−,k)P (rl2

j |zk,D−,k)P (zk|D−,k)

where the aligned roles rl1
j are connected
to zk, and D−,k refers to all the variables except
zk, rl1

i and rl2

i , and rl2
j .

We use the trained parameters to parse the
monolingual data using the monolingual model.
The crosslingual parameters are ignored even if
they were used during training. Thus, the infor-
mation coming from the CLVs acts as a regularizer
for the monolingual models.

6 Experiments
6.1 Evaluation
Following the setting of Titov and Klementiev
(2012b), we evaluate only on the arguments that
were correctly identiﬁed, as the incorrectly iden-
tiﬁed arguments do not have any gold semantic
labels. Evaluation is done using the metric pro-
posed by Lang and Lapata (2011a), which has 3
components: (i) Purity (PU) measures how well
an induced cluster corresponds to a single gold
role, (ii) Collocation (CO) measures how well a
gold role corresponds to a single induced cluster,
and (iii) F1 is the harmonic mean of PU and CO.
For each predicate, let N denote the total num-
ber of argument instances, Ci the instances in the
(cid:80)
induced cluster i, and Gj the instances having la-
i maxj|Ci∩Gj| ,
bel j in gold annotations. P U = 1
j maxi|Ci∩Gj| , and F 1= 2·P U·CO
P U +CO . The score
CO= 1
N
for each predicate is weighted by the number of
its argument instances, and a weighted average is
computed over all the predicates.

(cid:80)

N

6.2 Baseline
We use the same baseline as used by Lang and La-
pata (2011a) which has been shown to be difﬁcult
to outperform. This baseline assigns a semantic

role to a constituent based on its syntactic func-
tion, i.e. the dependency relation to its head.
If
there is a total of N clusters, (N − 1) most fre-
quent syntactic functions get a cluster each, and
the rest are assigned to the Nth cluster.

6.3 Closest Previous Work
This work is closely related to the cross-lingual
unsupervised SRL work of Titov and Klemen-
tiev (2012b). Their model has separate mono-
lingual models for each language and an extra
penalty term which tries to maximize P (rl2|rl1)
and P (rl1|rl2) i.e. for all the aligned arguments
with role label rl1 in language 1, it tries to ﬁnd
a role label rl2 in language 2 such that the given
proportion is maximized and vice verse. However,
there is no efﬁcient way to optimize the objec-
tive with this penalty term and the authors used
an inference method similar to annotation projec-
tion. Further, the method does not scale naturally
to more than two languages. Their algorithm ﬁrst
does monolingual inference in one language ignor-
ing the penalty and then does the inference in the
second language taking into account the penalty
term. In contrast, our model adds the latent vari-
ables as a part of the model itself, and not an exter-
nal penalty, which enables us to use the standard
Bayesian learning methods such as sampling.

The monolingual model we use (Garg and Hen-
derson, 2012) also has two main advantages over
Titov and Klementiev (2012b). First, the former
incorporates a global role ordering probability that
is missing in the latter. Secondly, the latter deﬁnes
argument-keys as a tuple of four syntactic features
and all the arguments having the same argument-
keys are assigned the same role. This kind of hard
clustering is avoided in the former model where
two constituents having the same set of features
might get assigned different roles if they appear in
different contexts.

6.4 Data
Following Titov and Klementiev (2012b), we run
our experiments on the English (EN) and Ger-
man (DE) sections of the CoNLL 2009 corpus
(Hajiˇc et al., 2009), and EN-DE section of the Eu-
roparl corpus (Koehn, 2005). We get about 40k
EN and 36k DE sentences from the CoNLL 2009
training set, and about 1.5M parallel EN-DE sen-
tences from Europarl. For appropriate compari-
son, we keep the same setting as in (Titov and
Klementiev, 2012b) for automatic parses and ar-

gument identiﬁcation, which we brieﬂy describe
here. The EN sentences are parsed syntactically
using MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007) and DE using
LTH parser (Johansson and Nugues, 2008). All
the non-auxiliary verbs are selected as predicates.
In CoNLL data, this gives us about 3k EN and 500
DE predicates. The total number of predicate in-
stances are 3.4M in EN (89k CoNLL + 3.3M Eu-
roparl) and 2.62M in DE (17k CoNLL + 2.6M Eu-
roparl). The arguments for EN are identiﬁed us-
ing the heuristics proposed by Lang and Lapata
(2011a). However, we get an F1 score of 85.1%
for argument identiﬁcation on CoNLL 2009 EN
data as opposed to 80.7% reported by Titov and
Klementiev (2012b). This could be due to imple-
mentation differences, which unfortunately makes
our EN results incomparable. For DE, the argu-
ments are identiﬁed using the LTH system (Jo-
hansson and Nugues, 2008), which gives an F1
score of 86.5% on the CoNLL 2009 DE data.
The word alignments for the EN-DE parallel Eu-
roparl corpus are computed using GIZA++ (Och
and Ney, 2003). For high-precision, only the inter-
secting alignments in the two directions are kept.
We deﬁne two semantic arguments as aligned if
their head-words are aligned. In total we get 9.3M
arguments for EN (240k CoNLL + 9.1M Europarl)
and 4.43M for DE (32k CoNLL + 4.4M Europarl).
Out of these, 0.76M arguments are aligned.

6.5 Main Results

Since the CoNLL annotations have 21 semantic
roles in total, we use 21 roles in our model as well
as the baseline. Following Garg and Henderson
(2012), we set the number of PRs to 2 (excluding
ST ART, EN D and P RED), and SRs to 21-2=19.
Table 1 shows the results.

In the ﬁrst setting (Line 1), we train and test the
monolingual model on the CoNLL data. We ob-
serve signiﬁcant improvements in F1 score over
the Baseline (Line 0) in both languages. Using the
CoNLL 2009 dataset alone, Titov and Klementiev
(2012b) report an F1 score of 80.9% (PU=86.8%,
CO=75.7%) for German. Thus, our monolingual
model outperforms their monolingual model in
German. For English, they report an F1 score
of 83.6% (PU=87.5%, CO=80.1%), but note that
our English results are not directly comparable to
theirs due to differences argument identiﬁcation,
as discussed in section 6.4. As their argument
identiﬁcation score is lower, perhaps their system

is discarding “difﬁcult” arguments which leads to
a higher clustering score.

In the second setting (Line 2), we use the ad-
ditional monolingual Europarl (EP) data for train-
ing. We get equivalent results in English and a
signiﬁcant improvement in German compared to
our previous setting (Line 1). The German dataset
in CoNLL is quite small and beneﬁts from the ad-
ditional EP training data. In contrast, the English
model is already quite good due to a relatively big
dataset from CoNLL, and good accuracy syntac-
tic parsers. Unfortunately, Titov and Klementiev
(2012b) do not report results with this setting.

The third setting (Line 3) gives the results of our
multilingual model, which adds the word align-
ments in the EP data. Comparing with Line 2,
we get non-signiﬁcant improvements in both lan-
guages. Titov and Klementiev (2012b) obtain
an F1 score of 82.7% (PU=85.0%, CO=80.6%)
for German, and 83.7% (PU=86.8%, CO=80.7%)
for English. Thus, for German, our multilingual
Bayesian model is able to capture the cross-lingual
patterns at least as well as the external penalty
term in (Titov and Klementiev, 2012b). We can-
not compare the English results unfortunately due
to differences in argument identiﬁcation.

We also compared monolingual and bilingual
training data using a setting that emulates the stan-
dard supervised setup of separate training and test
data sets. We train only on the EP dataset and
test on the CoNLL dataset. Lines 4 and 5 of Ta-
ble 1 give the results. The multilingual model
obtains small improvements in both languages,
which conﬁrms the results from the standard un-
supervised setup, comparing lines 2 to 3.

These results indicate that little information can
be learned about semantic roles from this parallel
data setup. One possible explanation for this re-
sult is that the setup itself is inadequate. Given
the deﬁnition of aligned arguments, only 8% of
English arguments and 17% of German arguments
are aligned. This plus our experiments suggest that
improving the alignment model is a necessary step
to making effective use of parallel data in multilin-
gual SRI, for example by joint modeling with SRI.
We leave this exploration to future work.

from a resource rich language to a resource poor
language. We evaluated our model in a very
general annotation transfer scenario, where we
have a small labeled dataset for one language
(source), and a large parallel unlabeled dataset for
the source and another (target) language. We in-
vestigate whether this setting improves the param-
eter estimates for the target language. To this end,
we clamp the role annotations of the source lan-
guage in the CoNLL dataset using a predeﬁned
mapping1, and do not sample them during train-
ing. This data gives us good parameters for the
source language, which are used to sample the
roles of the source language in the unlabeled Eu-
roparl data. The CLVs aim to capture this im-
provement and thereby improve sampling and pa-
rameter estimates for the target language. Table 2
shows the results of this experiment. We obtain
small improvements in the target languages. As
in the unsupervised setting, the small percentage
of aligned roles probably limits the impact of the
cross-lingual information.

6.7 Labeled Data in Monolingual Model
We explored the improvement in the monolingual
model in a semi-supervised setting. To this end,
we randomly selected S% of the sentences in the
CoNLL dataset as “supervised sentences” and the
rest (100−S)% were kept unsupervised. Next, we
clamped the role labels of the supervised sentences

using the predeﬁned mapping from Section 6.6.
Sampling was done on the unsupervised sentences
as usual. We then measured the clustering perfor-
mance using the trained parameters.2

To access the contribution of partial supervision
better, we constructed a “supervised baseline” as
follows. For predicates seen in the supervised sen-
tences, a MAP estimate of the parameters was cal-
culated using the predeﬁned mapping. For the un-
seen predicates, the standard baseline was used.

Figures 5a and 5b show the performance varia-

1A0 was mapped to the primary role P1, A1 to P2, and
the rest were mapped to the secondary roles (S1, ..., S19) in
the order of their decreasing frequency.

2To account for the randomness in selecting the super-
vised sentences, the experiment was repeated 10 times and
average of the performance numbers was taken.

• In both languages, at around S = 10, the su-
pervised baseline starts outperforming the semi-
supervised model, which suggests that manu-
ally labeling about 10% of the sentences is a
good enough alternative to our training proce-
dure. Note that 10% amounts to about 3.6k sen-
tences in German and 4k in English. We noticed
that the proportion of seen predicates increases
dramatically as we increase the proportion of
supervised sentences. At 10% supervised sen-
tences, the model has already seen 63% of pred-
icates in German and 44% in English. This
explains to some extent why only 10% labeled
sentences are enough.

• For German, it takes about 3.5% or 1260 super-
vised sentences to have the same performance
increase as 1.5M unlabeled sentences (Line 1 to
Line 2 in Table 1). Adding about 180 more su-
pervised sentences also covers the beneﬁt ob-
tained by alignments in the multilingual model
(Line 2 to Line 3 in Table 1). There is no no-
ticeable performance difference in English.

We also evaluated the performance variation on a
completely unseen CoNLL test set. Since the test
set is very small compared to the training set, the
clustering evaluation is not as reliable. Nonethe-
less, we broadly obtained the same pattern.

7 Related Work

As discussed in section 6.3, our work is closely re-
lated to the crosslingual unsupervised SRL work
of Titov and Klementiev (2012b). The idea of us-
ing superlingual latent variables to capture cross-
lingual information was proposed for POS tagging
by Naseem et al. (2009), which we use here for
SRL. In a semi-supervised setting, Pad´o and Lap-
ata (2009) used a graph based approach to trans-
fer semantic role annotations from English to Ger-
man. F¨urstenau and Lapata (2009) used a graph
alignment method to measure the semantic and
syntactic similarity between dependency tree ar-
guments of known and unknown verbs.

For monolingual unsupervised SRL, Swier and
Stevenson (2004) presented the ﬁrst work on a
domain-general corpus, the British National Cor-
pus, using 54 verbs taken from VerbNet. Garg
and Henderson (2012) proposed a Bayesian model
for this problem that we use here. Titov and

Klementiev (2012a) also proposed a closely re-
lated Bayesian model. Grenager and Manning
(2006) proposed a generative model but their pa-
rameter space consisted of all possible linkings of
syntactic constituents and semantic roles, which
made unsupervised learning difﬁcult and a sep-
arate language-speciﬁc rule based method had
to be used to constrain this space. Other pro-
posed models include an iterative split-merge al-
gorithm (Lang and Lapata, 2011a) and a graph-
partitioning based approach (Lang and Lapata,
2011b). M`arquez et al. (2008) provide a good
overview of the supervised SRL systems.

8 Conclusions

We propose a Bayesian model of semantic role
induction (SRI) that uses crosslingual latent vari-
ables to capture role alignments in parallel cor-
pora. The crosslingual latent variables capture cor-
relations between roles in different languages, and
regularize the parameter estimates of the mono-
lingual models. Because this is a joint Bayesian
model of multilingual SRI, we can apply the same
model to a variety of training scenarios just by
changing the inference procedure appropriately.
We evaluate monolingual SRI with a large unla-
beled dataset, bilingual SRI with a parallel cor-
pus, bilingual SRI with annotations available for
the source language, and monolingual SRI with
a small labeled dataset.
Increasing the amount
of monolingual unlabeled data signiﬁcantly im-
proves SRI in German but not in English. Adding
word alignments in parallel sentences results in
small, non signiﬁcant improvements, even if there
is some labeled data available in the source lan-
guage. This difﬁculty in showing the usefulness
of parallel corpora for SRI may be due to the
current assumptions about role alignments, which
mean that only a small percentage of roles are
aligned. Further analyses reveals that annotating
small amounts of data can easily outperform the
performance gains obtained by adding large unla-
beled dataset as well as adding parallel corpora.

Future work includes training on different lan-
guage pairs, on more than two languages, and with
more inclusive models of role alignment.
