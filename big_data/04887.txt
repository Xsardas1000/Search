Abstract. In this paper we study properties of endomorphisms of Pk using a symmetric product
construction (P1)k/Sk
∼= Pk. Symmetric products have been used to produce examples of endo-
morphisms of Pk with certain characteristics, k ≥ 2. In the present note, we discuss the use of these
maps to enlighten arithmetic phenomena and stability phenomena in parameter spaces. In partic-
ular, we study notions of uniform boundedness of rational preperiodic points via good reduction
information, k-deep postcritically ﬁnite maps, and characterize families of Latt`es maps.

Introduction

In this paper we study dynamical properties of endomorphisms of Pk, both from the arithmetic
and the complex point of view. We mainly focus on the dynamics of a symmetric product construc-
tion (P1)k/Sk ∼= Pk. Symmetric products have been used to produce examples of endomorphisms of
Pk with certain characteristics when k ≥ 2 and their dynamics over the ﬁeld C of complex numbers
is rather simple and completely understood (see [DS, FS, U], for example). In the present note,
we discuss the use of these maps to enlighten arithmetic phenomena and stability phenomena in
parameter spaces. In particular, we study notions of uniform boundedness of rational preperiodic
points via good reduction information, k-deep postcritically ﬁnite maps, and characterize families
of Latt`es maps (in particular those containing symmetric products).

Let d ≥ 2 be an integer. We denote by Homd(Pk) the space of holomorphic endomorphisms of
Pk of degree d. The space Homd(Pk) is known to be a smooth irreducible quasi-projective variety
of dimension Nd(k) := (k + 1) (d+k)!
d!·k! − 1. More precisely, it can be identiﬁed with an irreducible
Zariski open set of PNd(k), see e.g. [BB, §1.1].

Here, we mainly investigate properties of the following construction.

Deﬁnition 1. For any f ∈ Homd(P1), we deﬁne the k-symmetric product of f as the rational
mapping F : Pk 99K Pk making the following diagram commute

In Section 1 we prove various basic properties of the dynamics of the map F in relation to f .
Most of the properties we give seem classical. On the other hand, we did not ﬁnd any reference
for the arithmetic properties we need. In the remaining sections, we apply this construction to the
three following problems.

those obtained as k-symmetric products.

The Morton-Silverman Conjecture for symmetric products.

Given a map f ∈ Homd(Pk), we deﬁne the preperiodic points to be those with ﬁnite forward
orbit. Morton and Silverman conjectured the existence of a constant C bounding the number of
rational preperiodic points deﬁned over a number ﬁeld of degree at most D that depends only on
d, D, and k. More precisely, they proposed the following conjecture.
Conjecture (Morton-Silverman [MS]). Let d ≥ 2 be an integer and D, k ≥ 1 be integers. There
exists a constant C depending on d, D, and k such that for any morphism f ∈ Homd(Pk) the
number of preperiodic points deﬁned over a number ﬁeld of degree at most D is bounded by C.

This conjecture is open as stated; however some progress has been made under additional hy-
potheses, such as assuming that f has good reduction at a certain prime [B, H1]. We say that f
has good reduction at a prime p if f modulo p is a morphism of the same degree as f . In Section
2, we prove the following theorem in relation to this problem.
Theorem 2. Let d ≥ 2 be an integer and k ≥ 1 be an integer. Let K be a number ﬁeld and p ∈ K
be a prime. Let f ∈ Homd(P1) deﬁned over K with good reduction at p.

(1) Let P be a periodic point of minimal period n for f deﬁned over a Galois extension of degree

k of K. Then,

(2) If we assume the existence of a uniform Morton-Silverman constant over K for the k-
symmetric product of f as CF (K), then we can bound the number of rational preperiodic
points over any Galois extension of degree at most k as

C ≤ k · CF (K).

The ﬁrst part of Theorem 2 is similar to the bound from [H1], which allows f to be deﬁned
over the ﬁeld extension. Which bound is better depends on the properties of p and value of k.
The second part shows that one need only consider the preperiodic points deﬁned over the ﬁeld
of deﬁnition of the map for uniform boundedness in P1 and implies a linear growth in number of
rational preperiodic points with respect to the degree of the ﬁeld of deﬁnition of the points for a
ﬁxed degree of the ﬁeld of deﬁnition for the map.

Additionally, this construction provides a way to determine rational preperiodic points of ﬁelds
of bounded degree using the algorithm from [H2]. We give examples of a quadratic polynomial
with 21 rational preperiodic points over a degree 3 number ﬁeld and a quadratic polynomial with
a rational 5-cycle over a degree 5 number ﬁeld (see Example 1 and Example 2). Finally, we use the
k-symmetric product to give an algorithm to compute canonical heights of number ﬁelds where all
of the computations are performed over Q.1

Postcritically ﬁnite symmetric products.

In Section 3 we consider another problem. Recall that F ∈ Homd(Pk) is postcritically ﬁnite if

the postcritical set of F

P(F ) := [n≥1

F n(C(F )) ,

i.e., the forward orbit of C(F ), the critical locus of F , is a strict algebraic subvariety of Pk.
Deﬁnition 3. We say that F ∈ Homd(Pk) is 1-deep postcritically ﬁnite if F is postcritically ﬁnite
and F(1) := F|CF is postcritically ﬁnite, meaning the orbit under iteration of F of the critical locus
C(F(1)) of F(1) is an algebraic subvariety of pure codimension 2.
We say that F is (j + 1)-deep postcritically ﬁnite if it is j-deep postcritically ﬁnite and F(j+1) :=
F|C(F(j)) is postcritically ﬁnite.

We say that F is strongly postcritically ﬁnite if it is (k − 1)-deep postcritically ﬁnite.
Be aware that the notion of j-deep postcritically ﬁnite map diﬀers from the notion of j-critically
ﬁnite map deﬁned by Jonsson [J]. Indeed, in his deﬁnition Jonsson requires critical points to be
non-recurrent, hence non-periodic. We don’t exclude that possibility.

We focus on the following problem.

Question. Is a postcritically ﬁnite endomorphism of Pk necessarily strongly postcritically ﬁnite?

In the case when F is a symmetric product, we give a positive answer to this question. This
answers a question posed during the American Institute of Mathematics workshop Postcritically
ﬁnite maps in complex and arithmetic dynamics in the speciﬁc case of symmetric products.

Namely, we prove the following theorem.

Theorem 4. Let f ∈ Homd(P1) and F be the k-symmetric product of f for k ≥ 2. Then F is
strongly postcritically ﬁnite if and only if F is postcritically ﬁnite if and only if f is postcritically
ﬁnite.

We also provide a one-parameter family of degree 4 rational mappings Fa : P2 99K P2 that are

postcritically ﬁnite but not strongly postcritically ﬁnite.

Families of Latt`es maps of Pk.

Denote by Md(Pk) the moduli space of endomorphisms of Pk with algebraic degree d, i.e. the
set of PGL(k + 1) conjugacy classes of the space of degree d endomorphisms Homd(Pk). The space
Md(Pk) has been proven to have good geometric properties by Levy [L].

1The canonical height application was suggested by Joseph Silverman at the ICERM semester on complex and

arithmetic dynamics in 2010.

In Section 4 we examine families of Latt`es maps in the moduli space Md(Pk) of degree d endo-
morphisms of Pk. Our aim here is to have a complete description of non-trivial families of Latt`es
maps of Pk when k ≥ 2: an endomorphism f : Pk −→ Pk is a Latt`es map if there exists an abelian
variety T of dimension k, an aﬃne map D : T −→ T and a ﬁnite branched cover Θ : T −→ Pk
such that the following diagramm commutes

The complex dynamics of Latt`es maps has been deeply studied in several beautiful papers (see
e.g. [Mi, Z, BL1, BL2, BD1, Du]). The families and the perturbations of Latt`es maps of P1 are also
quite completely understood (see [Mi, BB, BG]).

Recall also that a family of degree d endomorphisms of Pk is a morphism f : Λ×Pk −→ Pk, where
Λ is a quasiprojective varierty of dimension m ≥ 1 and for all λ ∈ Λ, the map fλ := f (λ,·) : Pk −→
Pk is an endomorphism of algebraic degree d. Equivalently, the map λ ∈ Λ 7−→ fλ ∈ Homd(Pk)
if there exists a
is a morphism of quasiprojective varieties. We also say that (fλ)λ∈Λ is trivial
holomorphic map λ ∈ Λ 7−→ mλ ∈ PGL(k + 1, C) and λ0 ∈ Λ such that

λ ◦ fλ0 ◦ mλ , λ ∈ Λ .
Denote by Π : Homd(Pk) → Md(Pk) be the canonical projection.
Deﬁnition 5. When (fλ)λ∈Λ is a family of endomorphisms of Pk, we say that it has dimension
q in moduli if the set {Π(fλ) ; λ ∈ Λ} is an analytic set of Md(Pk) of dimension q. We then set
dimM(fλ, Λ) := q.

fλ = m−1

We focus on maximal families of Latt`es maps containing a speciﬁc Latt`es map f .

Deﬁnition 6. A family (fλ)λ∈Λ of Latt`es maps of Pk containing f ∈ Md(Pk) is maximal if for
any family (ft)t∈X of Latt`es maps containing also f , we have dimM(fλ, Λ) ≥ dimM(ft, X).

When k = 1, the families of Latt`es maps have been completely classiﬁed by Milnor [Mi]. He
proves that a family (ft) of Latt`es maps of P1 has positive dimension in moduli, i.e. is non-trivial,
if and only if d = a2 is the square of an integer a ≥ 2 and the aﬃne map inducing any map ft0 is
of the form z 7→ az + b. We aim here at giving a generalization of that precise statement.

Our main result on this problem is the following.

Theorem 7. Let f ∈ Md(Pk) be a Latt`es map and let D be an isogeny inducing f . Then, the
dimension in moduli of any family (fλ)λ∈Λ of Latt`es maps containing f satisﬁes dimM(fλ, Λ) ≤
k(k + 1)/2. More precisely, if (fλ)λ∈Λ is a maximal family containing f , then

(1) either the family is trivial, i.e. dimM(fλ, Λ) = 0, in which case the eigenspaces of the linear
part of D associated with √d and −√d are trivial,
(2) or dimM(fλ, Λ) = q > 0, in which case √d is an integer and the linear part of D has
eigenspaces associated with √d and −√d of respective dimensions q+ and q− with (q+ +
q−) · q++q−

2 = q for any λ ∈ Λ.

Beware that this result provides examples of families which are stable in the sense of Berteloot-
Bianchi-Dupont [BBD], since the function f 7→ L(f ), where L(f ) is the sum of Lyapunov exponents
of f with respect to its maximal entropy measure, is constant equal to k
2 log d, hence pluriharmonic
on any such family of Latt`es maps.

In Section 5, we come back to symmetric products and apply Theorem 7 to symmetric product
Latt`es maps. We give a precise description of maximal families of Latt`es maps on Pk containing
the k-symmetric products of a rational map. More precisely, we prove the following consequence
of Theorem 7.
Theorem 8. Let k ≥ 2 be an integer and let d ≥ 2 be an integer. Let F ∈ Homd(Pk) be the
k-symmetric product of f ∈ Homd(P1). Then

(1) f is rigid if and only if F is rigid,
(2) otherwise, F belongs to a family of Latt`es maps which has dimension k(k + 1)/2 in moduli.

In particular, F can be approximated by Latt`es maps which are not symmetric products.

We give a more precise result in dimension 2, relying on the work of Rong [R]. A few words
are in order to describe this result. Rong’s result says that (up to taking an appropriate iterate)
Latt`es maps on P2 are either symmetric product or preserve an algebraic web associated with a
cubic curve (see 5 for more details).
In turn, our Theorem 8 says that any symmetric product
Latt`es map is either rigid, or contained in a family of Latt`es maps of dimension 3 in moduli which
symmetric product locus is a strict subfamily of dimension 1 in moduli.

Finally, we give examples of rigid Latt`es maps of P2 and P3. We also provide an example of
a non-rigid family of Latt`es maps of P2. All three examples rely on Milnor’s famous examples of
Latt`es rational maps of degree 2 and 4 (see [Mi]).

1. Dynamics of symmetric products

This section is devoted to a description of the dynamics of symmetric products. Some of the
statements of the present section are known and classical, but many of the arithmetic properties
are not in the literature.

Let ηk : (P1)k −→ Pk be the holomorphic map deﬁned as the quotient map of the action of
symmetric group Sk on (P1)k by permutting the terms of the product.
In fact, one can write
ηk = [ηk,0 : ··· : ηk,k] where ηk,j is the homogeneous degree k symmetric function given by the
elementary homogeneous symmetric polynomials

We collect some basic properties of ηk in the following proposition.

Proposition 1.1. Let ηk : (P1)k −→ Pk be the k-th symmetric product map.

(1) The map ηk is a ﬁnite branched cover of algebraic degree k and topological degree k!.
(2) For any number ﬁeld K, the map ηk : Md(P1)(K) → Md(Pk)(K) is an embedding.

Proof.

(1) see e.g. [Ma] for more details about symmetric products.
(2) We need to show that a conjugate of f goes to a conjugate of F = ηk(f ). Let α ∈ PGL(2).
We denote the conjugate as f α = α ◦ f ◦ α−1. Choose k + 2 points {Pi} in P1(K) so that
no k + 1 of {ηk(Pi)} are co-hyperplanar and no k + 1 of {ηk(f α)(Pi)} are co-hyperplanar.
Since these are both closed conditions, we can ﬁnd such points. Deﬁne β ∈ PGL(k + 2) as
the map that sends {Pi} to {ηk(f α)(Pi)}. Then by construction we have

ηk ◦ f α = F β ◦ ηk.

To show injectivity, assume there are two distinct f, g such that ηk(f ) = ηk(g). Since
the maps are distinct, there must be some point P ∈ P1 such that f (P ) 6= g(P ) but that
ηk(f )(ηk(P )) = ηk(g)(ηk(P )). This is a contradiction, since the diagram commutes we must
have ηk(f )(ηk(P )) = ηk(f (P )) 6= ηk(g(P )) = ηk(g)(ηk(P )).

(cid:3)

One can actually show that the k-symmetric product of f is holomorphic and enjoys good

dynamical properties with respect to the ones of f .
Proposition 1.2. For any f ∈ Homd(P1), the k-symmetric product F of f is well-deﬁned. More-
over, it satisﬁes the following properties.

(1) F is an endomorphism of algebraic degree d of Pk.
(2) If f is a degree d polynomial mapping of P1, then F is a degree d polynomial mapping of

Pk, i.e., there is a totally invariant hyperplane.

(3) If K is the ﬁeld of deﬁnition of f , then F is also deﬁned over K.
(4) If K is the ﬁeld of moduli of the equivalence class [f ] ∈ Md(P1), then K is the ﬁeld of

moduli of the equivalence class [F ] ∈ Md(Pk).

Proof.

(1) Since f can be written f ([z : w]) = [P (z, w) : Q(z : w)] in homogeneous coordinates with
P, Q homogeneous polynomials, the map ηk ◦ (f, . . . , f ) : (P1)k → Pk is invariant under
the diagonal action of Sk. In particular, there exists homogeneous degree d polynomials
P0, . . . , Pk such that

and the map F exists as a rational mapping of Pk. Now, remark that

ηk ◦ (f, . . . , f ) = [P0 : ··· : Pk] ◦ ηk
k\j=0
{ηk,j ◦ (f, . . . , f ) = 0} = ∅

by construction and if x ∈ Pk is an indeterminacy point of F , it means that η−1
k {x} ∈
{ηk,j ◦ (f, . . . , f ) = 0} for any 0 ≤ j ≤ k, which is impossible. In particular, the map F has
no indeterminacy points.
(2) If f is a degree d polynomial, one can write f ([z : t]) = [P (z, t) : td], where P is homogeneous

of degree d. One then can write ηk ◦ (f, . . . , f )([z1 : t1], . . . , [zk : tk]) as follows:

Since ηk,k([z1 : t1], . . . , [zk : tk]) = Qj tj, this gives Pk(x0 : ··· : xk) = xd
k. Hence, the map
F can be written in homogeneous coordinates F ([x0 : ··· : xk]) = [P0(x0, . . . , xk) : ··· :
k]. Hence F −1{xk = 0} ⊂ {xk = 0}, i.e., the map F is a polynomial
Pk−1(x0, . . . , xk) : xd
endomorphism of Pk.

(3) This statement is obvious since the map ηk is deﬁned over Q.
(4) We deﬁne the ﬁeld of moduli of g ∈ Homd(Pk) is the smallest ﬁeld K such that [g] ∈

Md(Pk)(K). Equivalently, the ﬁeld of moduli is the ﬁxed ﬁeld of the set
G([g]) = {τ ∈ Gal(Q/Q) : gτ = gα for some α ∈ PGL(k + 1, Q)}.

Since we know from Proposition 1.1 that ηk is an embedding of the moduli space for each
element of G([f ]), there is a corresponding element in G([F ]) and the ﬁelds of moduli must
be the same.

(cid:3)

Let F ∈ Homd(Pk) be deﬁned over the ﬁeld of complex numbers. Let µF be the maximal entropy
measure of F : Pk → Pk. Let also πj : (P1)k → P1 be the projection onto the i-th coordinate. Recall
that the sum of Lyapunov exponents of F wih respect to µF is the real number

L(F ) :=ZPk

log |DF|µF ,

where |·| denotes any hermitian metric on Pk. One of the many consequences of the work of Briend
and Duval [BD2] is that that for any F ∈ Homd(Pk), we have L(F ) ≥ k log √d.

An easy result is the following. We include a proof for the sake of completeness.

Lemma 1.3. Let F ∈ Homd(Pk) be the k-symmetric product of f ∈ Homd(P1). Then

Proof. Let ˜f := (f, . . . , f ). First, one easily sees that the probability measure

L(F ) = k · L(f ) .

νf,k :=

k^j=1

(πj)∗µf

is ˜f -invariant and has constant jacobian dk. As a consequence, (ηk)∗(νf,k) is invariant and has
constant jacobian dk. Since the only probability measure having these properties of the maximal
entropy measure of F , we get

Hence

µF = (ηk)∗(νf,k) .

As νf,k is the intersection of closed positive (1, 1)-currents with continuous potentials on (P1)k, it
does not give mass to pluripolar sets. In particular, one has log | det Dηk| ∈ L1(νf,k) and

which ends the proof.

2. Preperiodic points and canonical heights via symmetric products

In this section we modify slightly ηk.

Instead of taking the symmetric product of k copies
(f, . . . , f ) or (P, . . . , P ), we work over a Galois ﬁeld and take the symmetric product of the k-Galois
conjugates. To preserve the embedding Md(P1) → Md(Pk) proven in Proposition 1.1, we need f to
be deﬁned over the ground ﬁeld. This is because the elementary multi-symmetric polynomials have
relations among them and if we need to consider ηk applied where both the coeﬃcients of the map
and the point have non-trivial conjugates, the resulting F must use multi-symmetric polynomials
and is not a morphism. To avoid confusion, we specify this as ˜ηk(P ) = ηk(P1, . . . , Pk) where Pi
are the Galois conjugates of P . Note that requiring Galois ﬁelds is not overly restrictive as we can
always extend to the Galois closure.

Remark. Note that ˜ηk is a cover of topological degree k which sends the k Galois conjugates to a
single point as opposed to ηk which is a cover of topological degree k!.
Lemma 2.1. Let L be an extension of the number ﬁeld K. Let S ⊂ L be the set of primes of
bad reduction for f : P1(L) → P1(L) with f deﬁned over K. Then the primes of bad reduction for
F = ˜ηk(f ) is the set {p ∩ K : p ∈ S}.
Proof. Assume that p is a prime of bad reduction of f . Then (modulo p) there is a point P = (x, y)
such that f (x, y) = (0, 0) with not both x, y = 0. So, we also have

F ( ˜ηk(P )) ≡ (0, . . . , 0)

(mod pOL ∩ K).

Since one of x, y 6= 0, we have at least one coordinate of ˜ηk(P ) 6= 0 and, thus, F has bad reduction.

Now assume that F has bad reduction at a prime p ∈ K. Then there is a point

P = (β0, . . . , βN )

8

such that F (P ) = (0, . . . , 0) with not all βi = 0. Thus, the polynomial deﬁning the Galois conjugates
βi is not identically 0:

NYi=1
(yiX − xiY ) = β0X N − β1X N−1Y + ··· + (−1)N βN Y N .

So there is at least one non-identically zero pair (xi, yi) for which f (xi, yi) = (0, 0). Thus, f has
bad reduction at a prime of L dividing p.
(cid:3)
Proposition 2.2. Let L be a Galois ﬁeld of degree k over K and let f : P1 → P1 be deﬁned over K.
The rational preperiodic points of F = ηk(f ) come from ηk(P1, . . . , Pk), where Pi are preperiodic
points for f . Furthermore, if each Pi is periodic of exact period ni, then ηk(P1, . . . , Pk) ∈ Pk is
periodic of exact period dividing lcm(ni) for F .
Proof. Since ηk ◦ f n = F n ◦ ηk, it is clear that preperiodic points go to preperiodic points and that
periodic points of exact period n for f are periodic points of exact period dividing n.

(cid:3)

Note that this allows one to ﬁnd all the rational periodic points deﬁned over a Galois ﬁeld L
with [L : K] = k for a map f : P1 → P1 deﬁned over K. In particular, this method searches over
all possible degree k extensions simultaneously.

We ﬁnd the Q rational preperiodic points of F and construct the corresponding number ﬁeld
preperiodic points for f . Every preperiodic point deﬁned over any number ﬁeld of degree 3 is among
these points. We ﬁnd that over Q(α) where the minimal polynomial of α is 64x3 + 16x2− 164x + 23,
there are 21 K-rational preperiodic points for f .
Over Q it is conjectured that there are at most 9 rational preperiodic points [P], and for quadratic

ﬁelds it is conjectured there are at most 15 rational preperiodic points [DFK, HI].
Example 2. Consider fc : P1 → P1 a quadratic polynomial deﬁned by f (x, y) = (x2 + cy2, y2).
For c ∈ {−2,−16/9,−64/9} there is a rational 5-cycle deﬁned over a degree 5 number ﬁeld. The
authors are not aware of any examples of 5-cycles for lower degree ﬁelds.
Proposition 2.3. Let f : P1 → P1 be deﬁned over K with periodic points P1, . . . , Pk. We determine
the characteristic polynomial of the multiplier matrices of ηk(f ) for ηk(P1, . . . , Pk). We will denote
the multiplier matrix for f at P as dfP .

(1) If a point with multiplier λ occurs m-times in (P1, . . . , Pk), then the characteristic polyno-

mial of dFηk(P1,...,Pk) will contain

(x − λ)(x − λ2)··· (x − λm).

9

(2) If ηk(P1, . . . , Pk) causes a mt-cycle to collapse to a t-cycle (this can occur when say the

whole cycle is contained in {P1, . . . , Pk}), then the characteristic polynomial will contain

(xm − λ).

Proof. We ﬁrst reduce to the case where the points in {P1, . . . , Pk} all have the same multiplier.
Let P = (P1, . . . , Pm, Pm+1, . . . , Pk) where the Pi for 1 ≤ i ≤ m all have the same multiplier.
Then we change coordinates so that the collection of points becomes

P = (P1, . . . , Pm, (0 : 1), . . . , (0 : 1)) .

The multiplier is a local object, so we can just consider f near P and F = ηk(f ) near ηk(P ).
Denote ˜F the restriction to the ﬁrst m coordinates of F . With P we have (ηk,1, . . . , ηk,k)(P ) =
(ηk,1, . . . , ηk,m, 0, . . . , 0). So the upper left k × k block of the multiplier matrix of F is the same as
the multiplier of ˜F . Since we can always rearrange coordinates, we are restricted to the case where
all the multipliers are the same.

Now assume P = (P1, . . . , Pm) all have the same multiplier λ (and are ﬁxed by f ). We can

change coordinates so that locally we have

f = [λx1 + O(x2

1),··· , λxm + O(x2

m)].

Note that locally the ηm,i are the elementary symmetric polynomials σi. If we evaluate the σi at
f , it is clear that the leading terms are

ηk(f ) = [λσ1 + O(σ2

1), λ2σ2 + O(σ2

2), . . . , λmσm + O(σ2

m)].

Now assume P = (P1, . . . , Pm, . . . , Pk) where P1, . . . , Pm form an m-cycle with multiplier λ for
f . In particular, ηk collapses this m-cycle to a ﬁxed point. Then we use the simple fact that if we
write f as a local power series

f (x) = λx + O(x2)

then

So that (f m)′(P1) = ··· = (f m)′(Pm) = Qm
non-constant, we must have f′(Pi) 6= f′(Pj) for i 6= j, so that Qm

f m(x) = λmx + O(x2).

i=1 f′(Pi) = λ. Since the Pi are distinct and f′ is

i=1(x − f′(Pi)) = xm − λ.

(cid:3)

We can now prove Theorem 2 about the boundedness of rational preperiodic points over an

extension of the base ﬁeld.
Proof of Theorem 2. We consider F = ˜ηk(f ) ∈ Homd(Pk) deﬁned over K. Additionally, any prepe-
riodic point P deﬁned over a Galois extension L/K of degree at most k gets sent by ˜ηk to a
preperiodic point deﬁned over K.

(1) We ﬁrst prove the bound on the length of a rational periodic cycle.

We know from [H1] that the minimal period of ˜ηk(P ) is decomposed as

n = mrpe

where m is the period modulo p for ˜ηk(P ) by F , r is the multiplicative order of the multiplier
of ˜ηk(P ) by F , p = p ∩ Q, and e is explicitly bounded as

We have

kXi=0

(N p)i

m ≤
r ≤ k · N (p).

The bound on m is simply the number of points modulo p in Pk. The bound on r is more
subtle. From Proposition 2.3 we have a relation between the multipliers of P and ˜ηk(P ).
The multiplicative order of the multiplier of P is either the same as the multiplicative order
of the multiplier of ˜ηk(P ) or the cycle collapses and the order increases. Since the cycle can
at most collapse by a factor of k, we have the given maximal possible multiplicative order
of the multiplier of ˜ηk(P ).

(2) We now prove the bound on the total number of preperiodic points. We are constructing
a bound Cf (k, K) on the number of L-rational preperiodic points where L is a Galois
extension of K of degree at most k. If CF (K) is a bound on the number of preperiodic
points for F over K, then since ˜ηK is a cover of degree k

Cf (k, K) ≤ k · CF (K).

(cid:3)

2.1. Canonical heights. To apply this construction to computing canonical heights over number
ﬁelds, we need to determine the relation between ˆhf (P ) and ˆhF ( ˜ηk(P )). We know that deg(f ) =
deg(F ) and that ˜ηk(f n(P )) = F n( ˜ηk(P )). So all we need to determine is the relation between the
heights

H(P )

and H( ˜ηk(P )).

There is a standard relation between the height of the coeﬃcients of a polynomial and the height
of its roots

We address the practical problem of computing the ˆhf (σ(αi)) by computing the local Green’s
functions with the “ﬂip-trick” as in [S1, Exercise 5.29]. Recall that we only need to compute the
Green’s functions for the primes of bad reduction, and the primes of bad reduction for f and F are
the same (Lemma 2.1).

3. Postcritically finite symmetric products

In this section, we prove Theorem 4. The proof of this result relies on the following description

of the critical set of F in terms of critical sets of f and ηk.

Lemma 3.1. The critical set of F is given by

C(F ) = ηk
k−1[s=0
(P1)s × C(f ) × (P1)k−s−1 ∪ [1≤i<j≤k

where ∆i,j = {x ∈ (P1)k ; xi = xj}.
Proof. First, note that the critical locus of F is the projection by ηk of the critical locus of the
map (f, . . . , f ) acting on (P1)k and of the critical locus of ηk. We, thus, just have to determine the
critical locus of (f, . . . , f ) and of ηk. The critical locus of (f, . . . , f ) obviously is

∆i,j


k−1[s=0
(P1)s × C(f ) × (P1)k−s−1,

and the critical locus of ηk is the set where the action of the group Sk is not simply transitive, i.e.
(x1, . . . , xk) ∈ (P1)k is in the critical set of η1
(cid:3)

k if and only if xi = xj for some 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k.

12

Proof of Theorem 4. Let us ﬁrst prove that F is postcritically ﬁnite if and only if f is postcritically
ﬁnite. Remark that the postcritical set of F is an algebraic variety if and only if it is the image
under ηk of an algebraic variety. According to Lemma 3.1, one, thus, sees that F is postcritically
ﬁnite if and only if the union of the iterates under the map (f, . . . , f ) (resp. (f, f )) of the set

(resp. ∆ ⊂ (P1)2), which is

k−1[s=0
(P1)s × C(f ) × (P1)k−s−1 ⊂ (P1)k

k−1[s=0
(P1)s × P(f ) × (P1)k−s−1 ⊂ (P1)k

(resp. the diagonal ∆ of (P1)2) is an algebraic variety of (P1)k (resp. (P1)2). Hence, F is post-
critically ﬁnite if and only if f is. Let us now prove that F is strongly postcritically ﬁnite if an
only if f is postcritically ﬁnite. By Lemma 3.1, the problem reduces to proving that (f, . . . , f ) is

strongly postcritically ﬁnite as a self-map of (P1)k and as a self-map of Si<j ∆i,j if and only if f is
postcritically ﬁnite. Let us proceed by induction on k ≥ 2. For k = 2, by Lemma 3.1, the critical
set of (f, f ) is P1 × C(f ) ∪ C(f ) × P1 and the critical set of its restriction to P1 × C(f ) ∪ C(f ) × P1
is C(f ) × C(f ). Moreover, the critical locus of the restriction of (f, f ) to ∆ is also C(f ) × C(f ).
Moreover, f is postcritically ﬁnite if and only if the restriction of (f, f ) to P1×C(f )∪C(f )× P1∪ ∆
is strongly postcritically ﬁnite, which concludes the proof for k = 2.
Assume now that for all 2 ≤ s < k, the s-symmetric product of f is strongly postcritically ﬁnite
if and only if f is. According to Lemma 3.1 and to the above discussion, it is suﬃcient to prove
that (f, . . . , f ) restricted to

k−1[s=0
(P1)s × C(f ) × (P1)k−s−1 ∪ [1≤i<j≤k

∆i,j

is strongly postcritically ﬁnite if and only if f is postcritically ﬁnite. By induction assumption,
the strong postcritical ﬁniteness of (f . . . , f ) on (P1)s × C(f ) × (P1)k−s−1 is equivalent to that of
f . Finally, there exists a map σi,j : (P1)k → (P1)k permuting coordinates such that σi,j(∆i,j) =
∆ × (P1)k−2, and the following diagram commutes

∆i,j

σi,j

(f,...,f )

∆i,j

σi,j

∆ × (P1)k−2

/ ∆ × (P1)k−2

In particular, the problem reduces to the case of the (k − 2)-symmetric product of f and the
induction assumption allows us to conclude.

(cid:3)

We now want to give a negative answer to the question in the case when indeterminacy points
are allowed. To do so, we provide an example based on a map from [KPR] of a degree 4 rational
mapping of P2 having the wanted properties. For any a ∈ C \ {0}, we let

Fa : [x : y : z] ∈ P2
This provides a good counter-example.

Proposition 3.2. The following holds:

an indeterminacy point of F 2

a is rational. Moreover, the critical locus of Fa is

a , hence F 2
C(Fa) = {x = 0} ∪ {y = 0} ∪ {z = x} .

But Fa({y = 0}) = {x = 0}, Fa({y = 0}) ⊂ {x = 0}, and Fa({x = z}) = {[1 : 0 : 0]} and we get

Hence, Fa is postcritically ﬁnite, as is F 2
not strongly postcritically ﬁnite, we look at the restriction

Fa(C(Fa)) ⊂ C(Fa) .

fa([z : t]) = [−a2z2(z − t)2 : (z2 − t2)2] = [−a2z2 : (z + t)2],

[z : t] ∈ P1. Its critical points are [0 : 1] and [1 : 1]. Moreover, fa([0 : 1]) = [0 : 1], hence, fa is a
quadratic polynomial. It is conjugate to the map

pa : z ∈ C 7→ z2 −

4. Families of Latt`es maps in dimension at least 2

Our proof decomposes in two steps. First, we prove that the induced analytic family of complex
dimension k tori up to biholomorphism has the same dimension as the family of Latt`es maps. We
then follow Milnor’s proof for the case k = 1 and adapt his argument.

4.1. Families of abelian varieties. This paragraph is devoted to recalling classical results con-
cerning abelian varieties. For the material of this paragraph, we refer to [De].
The moduli space of polarized abelian varieties.

A polarization on a complex abelian variety T is an entire K¨ahler form ω on T . To (T , ω) can
be associated integers d1|··· |dk and a matrix τ ∈ Mk(C) with τ t = τ and Im(τ ) > 0 such that
T = Ck/Γτ , with Γτ := τ Zk ⊕ ∆Zk and ∆ = diag(d1, . . . , dk) ∈ Mk(Z). We say T is of type ∆.

We now give the classical deﬁnition of the moduli space of type ∆ abelian varieties. Let

For any ﬁeld K, let Sp2k(K) be the symplectic group

Hk := {τ ∈ Mk(C) ; τ t = τ , Im(τ ) > 0}.

Ik

Sp2k(K) := {M ∈ GL2k(K) ; M JM t = J} ,

0 (cid:19) ∈ M2k(K). We also let σ∆ : GL2k(Q) −→ GL2k(Q) be deﬁned by
σ∆(M ) :=(cid:18) Ik

0 ∆ (cid:19) , M ∈ GL2k(Q).

M(cid:18) Ik

0

where J =(cid:18) 0
−Ik

0 ∆ (cid:19)−1
Finally, we let G∆ := σ∆(M2k(Z)) ∩ Sp2k(Q).

The well-deﬁned map

M =(cid:18)(cid:18) A B

C D (cid:19) , τ(cid:19) 7−→ M · τ := (Aτ + B)(Cτ + D)−1

deﬁnes an action of the group Sp2k(R) on Hk. Moreover, any discrete subgroup of Sp2k(R) acts
properly discontinuously on Hk. The main result we rely on is that two polarized abelian varieties
Ck/Γτ and Ck/Γγ of type ∆ are isomorphic if and only if there exists M ∈ G∆ with M · τ = γ.
Deﬁnition 4.1. The moduli space Ak,∆ of polarized abelian variety of type ∆ is the set of isomor-
phism classes of such varieties. Equivalently, this is Hk/G∆.

It is known that the moduli space Ak,∆ is a quasi-projective variety and that it has dimension
k(k + 1)/2.
Dimension in moduli of families of abelian varieties. We say that (Tt)t∈X is a holomorphic family
of abelian varieties if there exists a complex manifold bT and a holomorphic map p : bT −→ X, such
that p−1{t} = Tt for all t ∈ X.
We want to deﬁne properly a notion of dimension in moduli for the family (Tt)t∈X . First, notice
that the polarization of Tt is deﬁned by an entire K¨ahler form. As seen in the proof of [De,
Proposition VI.1.3], when t varies in X, the integers d1|··· |dk cannot change. In particular, the
type of the polarization is constant in the family (Tt)t∈X and there exists a holomorphic map
t ∈ X 7−→ τ (t) ∈ Hk with Tt = Ck/(τ (t)Zk ⊕ ∆Zk) for all t ∈ Hk.
As a consequence, we can deﬁne the type of a holomorphic family (Tt)t∈X of abelian varieties as
the type Tt0 of any t0 ∈ X.
Deﬁnition 4.2. We say that a holomorphic family (Tt)t∈X of abelian varieties of type ∆ has
dimension q in moduli if the analytic set Π∆(Λ) ⊂ Ak,∆ has dimension q.
4.2. Latt`es maps and abelian varieties.
Families of Latt`es maps. Recall that F ∈ Homd(Pk) is a Latt`es map if there exists a complex k-
dimensional abelian variety T , an aﬃne map I : T → T , and a Galois branched cover Θ : T → Pk
making the following diagram commute

[Du]). These maps are known to be postcritically ﬁnite (see e.g.

[BD1]). Another way
(see e.g.
to present Latt`es maps, given by Berteloot and Loeb [BL2, Th´eor`eme 1.1 & Proposition 4.1], is
the following (see also [BD1]): A complex crystallographic group G is a discrete group of aﬃne
transformations of a complex aﬃne space V such that the quotient X = V /G is compact.

A degree d endomorphism F : Pk −→ Pk is a Latt`es map if there exists a ramiﬁed cover
σ : Ck −→ Pk, an aﬃne map A : Ck −→ Ck whose linear part is √d · U where U ∈ U(k) is
a diagonal unitary linear map, and a complex crystallographic group G such that the following
diagram commutes:

Lemma 4.3. Let (ft)t∈X be any holomorphic family of Latt`es maps of Pk. Then there exists a
holomorphic family of complex crystallographic groups (Gt)t∈X , a holomorphic family of branched
covers (σt)t∈X , and a holomorphic family of aﬃne maps (At)t∈X , as above. Moreover, the linear
part of At is independent of t.
Proof. Let (ft)t∈X be a holomorphic family of Latt`es maps and let Gt, At and σt be such that
σt ◦ At = ft ◦ σt on Ck. It is obvious that Gt, At and σt depend holomorphically on t. Moreover,
the linear part of At can be written √d · Ut with Ut ∈ U(k) ⊂ GLk(C) and the map t 7→ Ut is
holomorphic. Hence, it has to be constant.

(cid:3)

Equality of the dimensions in moduli. We now may prove the following key fact.
Proposition 4.4. Let (fλ)λ∈Λ be a holomorphic family of degree d Latt`es maps of Pk, and let
(Tλ)λ∈Λ be any induced family of abelian varieties. Then the family (fλ)λ∈Λ has dimension q in
moduli if and only if (Tλ)λ∈Λ has dimension q in moduli.
Proof. Pick any induced holomorphic family of tori (Tt)t∈Λ. Let q and r stand, respectively, for
the dimension in moduli of (ft)t∈Λ and (Tt)t∈Λ. Assume ﬁrst that r > q. Choose t0 ∈ Λ. By
assumption, there exists a holomorphic disk D ⊂ Λ centered at t0 and such that (Tt)t∈D has
dimension 1 in moduli and the canonical projection Π : D 7−→ Md(Pk) is constant. In particular,
there exists a holomorphic disk (φt)t∈D of P SL(k + 1, C) such that ft = φ−1
t ◦ ft0 ◦ φt on Pk. Since
(Tt)t is an induced family of abelian varieties, we have
Tt

/ Pk .

ft0

As a consequence, φt ◦ Θt : Tt → Pk and Θt0 : Tt0 → Pk are isomorphic Galois branched cover.
Hence, there exists an analytic isomorphism ψt : Tt → Tt0 for any t ∈ D. Hence, Tt is isomorphic
to Tt0 for any t ∈ D. This implies that (Tt)t∈D is trivial in moduli. This is a contradiction.

For the converse inequality, we also proceed by contradiction. Assume r < q. Since Md(Pk) is a
geometric quotient, for any t0 ∈ Λ, there exists a local dimension q complex submanifold X0 ⊂ Λ
containing t0 and such that the canonical projection Π : X0 7−→ Md(Pk) has discrete ﬁbers over
its image.
As above, this implies the existence of a holomorphic disk D ⊂ X0 centered at t0 and such that
the corresponding family (Tt)t∈D is trivial in moduli, i.e. Tt ≃ Tt0 as abelian varieties for any t ∈ D.
We, thus, may assume that T := Tt0 = Tt for all t ∈ D. We, thus, have a holomorphic family
(Dt)∈D of degree √d isogenies of T and a holomorphic family of Galois covers Θt : T −→ Pk with

Let Γ be a lattice deﬁning T , i.e. such that T = Ck/Γ. Lifting Dt to an aﬃne map ˜Dt : Ck −→ Ck,
we end up with a holomorphic map t ∈ D 7−→ ˜Dt ∈ Aﬀ(Ck), which satisﬁes ˜Dt(Γ) ⊂ Γ and
˜Dt = √d · Ut + τt with Ut ∈ Uk and τt ∈ 1
2 Γ. As a consequence, the map t 7→ ˜Dt is discrete, hence
constant. The family (Dt)t∈D is thus constant. Let D := Dt for all t.

Finally, by assumption, there exists an isomorphism αt : Tt → Tt0 for all t ∈ D, which depends
analytically on t. Hence Θt = Θt0 ◦ αt for all t ∈ D, and (Θt)t∈D is a holomorphic family of Galois
cover of Pk which are isomorphic. As a consequence, there exists a holomorphic disk t ∈ D 7−→
φt ∈ P SL(k + 1, C) such that Θt = φt ◦ Θt0, for all t ∈ D. Hence, we get

φt ◦ (Θt0 ◦ D) = (ft ◦ φt) ◦ Θt0

which we may rewrite

ft0 ◦ Θt0 = Θt0 ◦ D =(cid:0)φ−1

t ◦ ft ◦ φt(cid:1) ◦ Θt0 .

This gives ft0 = φ−1
discrete in X0.

t ◦ ft ◦ φt, i.e. D ⊂ Π−1{ft0}. This is a contradiction since the ﬁbers of Π are

(cid:3)

An immediate consequence is the following.

Corollary 4.5. Let (fλ)λ∈Λ be a holomorphic family of degree d Latt`es maps of Pk. Then the
family (fλ)λ∈Λ has dimension in moduli at most k(k + 1)/2.
4.3. Classiﬁcation of maximal families of Latt`es maps. We now want to prove Theorem 7.
We use the description of Berteloot and Loeb of Latt`es maps [BL2]. When U ∈ L(Ck), we denote
by Eλ := ker (λIk − U ) the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue λ ∈ C.

We may prove the following.

Theorem 4.6. Assume (ft)t∈X is a maximal family of Latt`es maps containing f and let D =
√d · U + γ be the aﬃne map inducing f . Let q± := dimC ker(U ± Ik); then

dimM(ft, X) = (q+ + q−) ·

q+ + q− + 1

.

Remark. Let (ft)t∈X be any holomorphic family of Latt`es maps of Pk, let (At)t∈X be the holo-
morphic family of aﬃne maps given by Lemma 4.3, and write √d · U the linear part of At with
U ∈ U(k). Be aware that for any integer m ∈ Z, since U is unitary, we have dimC Em(√d · U ) = 0
for all m 6= ±√d and dimC Em(√d · U ) = 0 for all m if d is not the square on an integer.
Proof. Up to taking a connected subvariety of X, we may assume q := dim(ft) = dimM(ft).
According to Proposition 4.4, the induced family of abelian varieties (Tt)t∈X has also dimension q
in moduli.
Choose t0 ∈ X. Notice that, by Lemma 4.3, if At : Tt → Tt is the aﬃne map inducing ft, then
At for all t has linear part √dU ∈ U(k) independent of t. Our assumption implies that the isogeny

A = (At)t preserves a family of abelian varieties with dimension in moduli q. Set

q∗ :=(cid:16)q√d + q

We now may prove it implies q = q∗. We prove ﬁrst q ≥ q∗. If q∗ = 0, this is trivial. Otherwise, up
to linear change of coordinates, we have

U =

where ⋆ is a (k − q∗)-square diagonal unitary matrix. Let Γ0 = τ0Zk + ∆Zk be a lattice preserved
by At0 with Tt0 ≃ Ck/Γτ0 . Write

τ0 =(cid:18) τ1,1

τ t

17

τ1,2

τ2,2 (cid:19)

where τ1,1 ∈ Hq∗, τ2,2 ∈ Hk−q∗ and τ1,2 is a (q∗, k − q∗)-matrix. For λ ∈ Hq∗, we let

τ (λ) :=(cid:18) λ

τ t
1,2

τ1,2

τ2,2 (cid:19) ∈ Hk.

Let Tλ := Ck/Γλ. The family (Tλ) has dimension q∗ in moduli. Remark also that

for some α ∈ C∗ (resp. u, v ∈ α · Zk) and that this property has to be preserved in any family of
Latt`es maps containing f . Hence, we may let

γ = τ0 · u + ∆ · v ∈ α · Γ0

γ(λ) := τ (λ) · u + ∆ · v ∈ α · Γλ , λ ∈ Λ ,

so that the map γ : Λ → Ck is holomorphic and the map Aλ := √d · U + γ(λ) induces an isogeny
of the abelian variety Tλ. Moreover, we have Tτ1,1 ≃ Tt0 and ft0 is induced by Aτ0. Hence, ft0
belongs to a family of Latt`es maps which is parameterized by Λ. By Proposition 4.4, this family
has dimension at least q∗ in moduli, and q ≥ q∗.

We now prove the converse inequality by contradiction, assuming q > q∗. Assume ﬁrst that
q∗ = 0. Since q > 0, we again can ﬁnd a holomorphic disk D ⊂ X with dim Π∆(D) = 1 where ∆ is
the type of the family (Tt)t∈D. By assumption, U ∈ U(k) is diagonal and has no integer eigenvalue.
Hence, U = diag(u1, . . . , uk) with |ui| = 1 and u2
i 6= 1. On the other hand, if σt : Ck → Pk is the
Galois cover making the following diagram commute

for any t ∈ D, any z ∈ Ck, and any a ∈ Γt, we ﬁnd
This gives √d · U (Γt) ⊂ Γt for all t. In particular, if (e1, . . . , ek) is the canonical basis of Ck

σt(√d · U (z) + γt) = ft(σt(z)) = ft(σt(z + a)) = σt(√d · U (z + a) + γt).

√d · (U ◦ τt) · ei = τt · u + ∆ · v

for some u, v ∈ Zk, and τt is a non-constant holomorphic map of the parameter t by assumption.
Since √d · U is diagonal, this gives
√d · ui

τt,i,jδi,j =

kXj=1

This is impossible, since it gives that τt is constant on D hence that (Tt) is a trivial family.
Assume ﬁnally that q∗ > 0. As in the proof of Proposition 4.4, since Md(Pk) is a geometric
quotient, for any t0 ∈ X there exists a local dimension q complex submanifold X0 ⊂ X containing
t0 and such that the canonical projection Π : X0 7−→ Md(Pk) has discrete ﬁbers over its image.
Notice that for any t0 ∈ X, there exists a polydisk Dq∗ centered at t0 in X0, as described above.
By assumption, there exists a disk D centered at t0 which is transverse to Dq∗. As above, write
Γt = τ (t)Zk ⊕ ∆Zk and decompose τ (t):

τ (t) :=(cid:18) τ1,1(t)

where τi,j(t) is holomorphic on t ∈ D. Let Γ′t := τ2,2(t)Zk + ∆′Zk, where

∆′ = diag(dk−q∗+1, . . . , dk)

and the di’s are given by ∆ = diag(d1, . . . , dk) with di|di+1. Up to reducing D, we may assume Γ′t is
not G∆′-equivalent to Γ′t0 and that ∆′ is the type of the family (T ′t )t∈D of abelian varieties deﬁned as
T ′t := Ck−q∗/Γ′t. We now let U′ = diag(uk−q∗+1, . . . , uk) ∈ U(k− q∗) where, again, the ui’s are given
by U = diag(u1, . . . , uk). We ﬁnally let γ′t = (γt,k−q∗+1, . . . , γt,k) ∈ Ck−q∗ and A′t := √d · U′ + γ′t.
The family (T ′t , At)t induces a family of Latt`es maps on Pk−q∗ with dim(U′ ∓ Ik−q∗) = 0. We thus
have reduced to the case q∗ = 0.

An immediate corollary is

Corollary 4.7. The dimension in moduli of (ft)t∈X is non-zero if and only if d is the square of
an integer and the linear map U has at least one integer eigenvalue.

We now derive Theorem 7 from Theorem 4.6.

Proof of Theorem 7. If dimM(fλ, Λ) = 0, then by Theorem 4.6, 0 = q√d + q
q
±

−√d. Since both
√d ≥ 0, we must have q√d = q
On the other hand, suppose dimM(fλ, Λ) > 0. Again by Theorem 4.6, at least one of q√d
−√d must be positive. Recall that U , the linear part of At, is unitary. Thus, we have
qm := dimC Em(√d · U ) = 0 for all m 6= ±√d and qm = 0 for all m if d is not the square on an

√d = 0.

±√d must be positive, the result follows.

Among symmetric products, we can easily characterize Latt`es ones.

5. Symmetric product Latt`es maps

Proposition 5.1. Let k, d ≥ 2 and let f ∈ Homd(P1), and let F ∈ Homd(Pk) be the k-symmetric
product of f . Then F is a Latt`es map if and only if f is a Latt`es map. Moreover, if T is an elliptic
curve, I : T → T is aﬃne and Θ : T → P1 is the Galois cover such that

T

Proof. Berteloot and Dupont [BD1] proved that F is Latt`es if and only L(F ) = k log √d. A
similar result was known by [Z] in dimension 1. Namely, f ∈ homd(P1) is Latt`es if and only if
L(f ) = log √d. The fact that F is Latt`es if and only if f is Latt`es follows directly from Lemma 1.3.
Assume now that f is a Latt`es map induced by I : T → T under the Galois cover Θ : T → P1. By

which concludes the proof.

We now come to the proof of Theorem 8.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 8. It is classical that f is rigid if and only if the linear part of the induced isogeny
A is not an integer (see [Mi]). We now let F be the k-symmetric product of f . We have the following
alternatives:

(1) either q√d + q
(2) or q√d = k (or q

−√d = 0,

√d = k).

We now just have to apply Theorem 7.

(cid:3)

In dimension 2. An algebraic web is given by a reduced curve C ⊂ (P2)⋆, where (P2)⋆ is the dual
projective plane consisting of lines in P2. The web is invariant for a holomorphic map f on P2 if
every line in P2 belonging to C is mapped to another such line.

In [R, Theorems 4.2 & 4.4], Rong Feng gave the following description of Latt`es maps on P2: pick

a Latt`es map F ∈ Homd(P2), then

Homd2(P1)),

• either F or F 2 is the 2-symmetric product of a Latt`es map f ∈ Homd(P1) (resp. f ∈
• or F , F 2, F 3 or F 6 is a holomorphic map preserving an algebraic web associated to a

smooth cubic.

Combined with Theorem 8, this description directly gives the following result.
Corollary 5.2. Let F ∈ Homd(P2) be a 2-symmetric product Latt`es map. Then

(1) either F is a rigid 2-symmetric product,
(2) or F is a 2-symmetric product which belongs to a family of Latt`es maps whic has dimension
3 in moduli. In that case, F can be approximated by Latt`es maps admitting a suitable iterate
which preserve an algebraic web associated to a smooth cubic. More precisely, any maximal
subfamily of symmetric products has dimension 1 in moduli.

Proof. According to Theorem 8, either F is rigid or F belongs to a family of Latt`es maps which
has dimension 3 in moduli. Now, if F belongs to such a family, there is a maximal subfamily (Ft)t
which consists in symmetric products which has dimension 1. The family (F m
t )t is also a maximal
family of symmetric products for all m ≥ 1. The result follows from Rong’s classiﬁcation.
(cid:3)
Explicit examples. We now give exlicit examples.

Example 4 (Rigid Latt`es maps of P2 and P3). In [Mi], Milnor provided an example of degree 2
Latt`es map f ∈ Rat2:

f : [z : t] 7→ [z2 + a2zt : t2 + a2zt].

As deg(f ) is not the square of an integer, f has to be isolated in M2 (see e.g. [Mi]). The 2-symmetric
product of f is F : P2 → P2 given by

[z : t : w] 7→ [F1 : F2 : F3] ,

where F1(z, t, w) = z2 + a2zw + a4zt, F2(z, t, w) = z2 + a2tw + a4zt and F3(z, t, w) = w2 + a2zw +
a2tw + 2(a4 − 1)zt). We now turn to the 3-symmetric product of f .

The 3-symmetric product of f is G : P3 → P3 given by

[z : t : w : u] 7→ [G1 : G2 : G3 : G4] ,

where

G1(z, t, w, u) = z2 + a2uz + a4zw + a6zt,
G2(z, t, w, u) = t2 + a2wt + a4ut + a6zt,
G3(z, t, w, u) = w2 + a4zw + a2wt + 3a6zt + a2wu − 3a2zt − 2tu + 2a4ut,
G4(z, t, w, u) = u2 + 3a6zt + a2wu − 3a2zt − 2zw + a4zw + a4ut + a2uz

+a4zw.

By Theorem 7, since f is rigid, both maps F and G are rigid Latt`es maps, respectively, in the
moduli spaces M2(P2) and M2(P3).
Example 5 (Flexible Latt`es maps of P2). The one-dimensional family (fλ)λ∈C\{0,1} of degree 4
maps

fλ : [z : t] ∈ P1 7−→ [(z2 − λt2)2 : 4zt(z − t)(z − λt)]

is a family of ﬂexible Latt`es maps of P1. The family of 2-symmetric products Fλ : P2 → P2 given
for λ ∈ C \ {0, 1} by

where

[z : t : w] 7→ [F1,λ : F2,λ : F3,λ] ,

F1,λ(z, t, w) = ((z + λw)2 − λt2)2,
F2,λ(z, t, w) = (z + λw)3t + 2(λ + 1)(z + λw)2zw + λ(z + λw)t3 − 8λzwt(z + λw)

−(λ + 1)(z2t2 + 3λz2w2 + λ2t2w2) ,

F3,λ(z, t, w) = 4zw(z − t + w)(z − λt + λ2w)

is a family of ﬂexible Latt`es maps of P2. Moreover, it is a strict subfamily of a 2-dimensional family
of ﬂexible Latt`es maps.
