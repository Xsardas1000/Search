SYNTOMIC COHOMOLOGY AND p-ADIC MOTIVIC COHOMOLOGY

VERONIKA ERTL AND WIES LAWA NIZIO L

Abstract. We prove a mixed characteristic analog of the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum Conjecture for p-adic
motivic cohomology. It gives a description, in the stable range, of p-adic motivic cohomology (deﬁned
using algebraic cycles) in terms of diﬀerential forms. This generalizes a result of Geisser [10] from small
Tate twists to all twists and uses as a critical new ingredient the comparison theorem between syntomic
complexes and p-adic nearby cycles proved recently in [8].

For a smooth variety over a ﬁeld of characteristic zero, the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum Conjecture states

that, in a certain stable range, the p-adic motivic cohomology is equal to the ´etale cohomology:

1. Introduction

H i

M(X, Z/pn(r)) ∼→ H i

´et(X, Z/pn(r)),

i ≤ r.

Here motivic cohomology is deﬁned as the hypercohomology of the Bloch’s cycle complex Z/pn(r)M. This
conjecture follows [31] from the Bloch-Kato Conjecture that was proved by Voevodsky and Rost [35].

For a smooth variety over a ﬁeld of positive characteristic p, the analog of the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum
Conjecture states that, in the same stable range, the p-adic motivic cohomology is equal to the logarithmic
de Rham-Witt cohomology:

It was proved by Geisser-Levine [11].

H i

M(X, Z/pn(r))

∼
→ H i−r

´et (X, WnΩr

X,log),

i ≤ r.

The purpose of this note is to prove a mixed characteristic analog of the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum
Conjecture for p-adic motivic cohomology. Let X be a semistable scheme over OK – a complete discrete
valuation ring with fraction ﬁeld K of characteristic 0 and with perfect residue ﬁeld k of characteristic p.
We ﬁx a uniformizer ̟ of K. Let F be the fraction ﬁeld of the ring of Witt vectors W (k). We assume
that the special ﬁber X0 of X is smooth and treat X as a log-scheme. We show that, in the same stable
range as above, the p-adic motivic cohomology of Xtr – the open set where the log-structure is trivial –
is equal to the (logarithmic) syntomic-´etale cohomology of X. This relates algebraic cycles to diﬀerential
forms.

Corollary 1.1. We have the following natural isomorphism1

H i

M(Xtr, Qp(r)) ∼→ H i

´et(X, E(r))Q,

i ≤ r,

where E(·) denotes the syntomic-´etale cohomology complex. If X is proper, this yields the following natural
isomorphism

M(Xtr, Qp(r)) ∼→ H i
where S(·) denotes the syntomic cohomology complex.

H i

´et(X, S(r))Q,

i ≤ r,

The rational syntomic cohomology H ∗

´et(X, S(r))Q above is that deﬁned in [9] as ﬁltered Frobenius
eigenspace of crystalline cohomology2. We show in the appendix that it is isomorphic to the logarithmic
version of the convergent syntomic cohomology deﬁned in [25] as well as to the rigid syntomic cohomology
deﬁned in [2, 13].

The above corollary is a simple consequence of the following theorem which is the main result of this

paper.

Theorem 1.2. Let r ≥ 0. Let j′
cycle class maps between complexes of sheaves on the Nisnevich site of X0

∗ : Xtr → X be the natural open immersion. Then there are natural

∗Z/pn(r)M → E ′

n(r)Nis,

clsyn

r

: i∗Rj′

∗Z/pn(r)M → S′

n(r)Nis,

where i : X0 ֒→ X is the special ﬁber of X. They are compatible with the ´etale cycle class maps and are
pN -quasi-isomorphisms, i.e., the kernels and cokernels of the maps induced on the cohomology sheaves
are annihilated by pN for a constant N = N (e, p, r), which depends on the absolute ramiﬁcation index e
of K, r, but not on X or n3.

The syntomic-´etale cohomology E ′

n(r) was deﬁned by Fontaine-Messing [9] by gluing syntomic cohomol-
ogy S′
n(r) on X0 with ´etale cohomology on the generic ﬁber via the relative fundamental exact sequence
of p-adic Hodge Theory. It is a complex of sheaves on the ´etale site of X. We extend this deﬁnition
to logarithmic schemes (where one replaces syntomic cohomology by logarithmic syntomic cohomology).
The Nisnevich version that appears in the above theorem is deﬁned by projecting to the Nisnevich site
and truncating at r:

n(r)Nis := τ≤rRε∗E ′
E ′
where ε : X´et → XNis is the natural projection.

n(r), S′

n(r)Nis := τ≤rRε∗S′

n(r),

The syntomic part of the above theorem (hence of the above corollary as well), for twists r ≤ p − 2
(where no constants are needed) was proved by Geisser4 [10, Theorem 1.3]. The key ingredient in his
proof is the exact sequence of Kurihara [20] that links syntomic cohomology with p-adic nearby cycles
coupled with the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum Conjecture over ﬁelds of characteristic zero and p. Our proof
of Theorem 1.2 proceeds in a similar manner using as the main new ingredient the relation between
syntomic complexes and p-adic nearby cycles proved recently in [8].

We will now describe it brieﬂy in the case when there is no log-structure. First, we show that we have

the pN r-distinguished triangle (on the ´etale site of X0), for a universal constant N ,

(1.1)

n(r)X → E ′

added log-structure coming from the special ﬁber. The syntomic-´etale cohomology E ′

2It diﬀers from the one deﬁned in [22] by the absence of log-structure associated to the special ﬁber.
3If K has enough roots of unity then N = N ′r for a universal constant N ′ (not depending on p, X, K, n or r). See
Section (2.1.1) of [8] for what it means for a ﬁeld to contain enough roots of unity. The ﬁeld F contains enough roots of
unity and for any K, the ﬁeld K(ζpn ), for n ≥ c(K) + 3, where c(K) is the conductor of K, contains enough roots of unity.
4Geisser’s result was conditional on the Bloch-Kato Conjecture which at the time of the publication of his paper was

not a theorem yet.

where j∗ : XK ֒→ X and Z/pn(r)′ = (paa!)−1Z/pn(r) for r = (p − 1)a + b, a, b ∈ Z, 0 ≤ b < p − 1 .
Projecting it to the Nisnevich site and truncating at r we obtain the Nisnevich syntomic-´etale period
map

αr : E ′

n(r)X ×,Nis → τ≤rRε∗Rj∗Z/pn(r)′

XK .

The computations of p-adic nearby cycles via syntomic cohomology from [8] imply that this is a pN -
quasi-isomorphism, for a constant N as in the theorem. Hence, from (1.1), we obtain the pN -distinguished
triangle

Next, we note that the localization sequence in motivic cohomology yields the following distinguished

triangle (on the Nisnevich site of X)

Z/pn(r)M → j∗Z/pn(r)M → i∗Z/pn(r − 1)M[−1].

By the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum Conjecture and the computations of Geisser-Levine [11] of motivic coho-
mology in characteristic p, we have the cycle class map quasi-isomorphisms
∼→ WnΩr

∼→ τ≤rRε∗Z/pn(r)XK , Z/pn(r)M

The above triangle becomes

Z/pn(r)M → j∗τ≤rRε∗Z/pn(r)XK → i∗WnΩr−1

X0,log[−r]

Since j∗Z/pn(r)M
now be obtained by comparing sequences (1.2) and (1.3).

∼→ Rj∗Z/pn(r)M, τ≤rZ/pn(r)M

∼→ Z/pn(r)M, the cycle class map of Theorem 1.2 can

As a byproduct of the computations in the proof of Theorem 1.2, we obtain that the triangle (1.2)

splits up to pN , N = N (p, e, r). The following corollary follows.

Corollary 1.3. Let X be a smooth scheme over OK. We have a natural isomorphism

H ∗

M(X, Qp(r)) ⊕ H ∗−1

M (X0, Qp(r − 1)) ∼→ H ∗

M(XK, Qp(r)).

many discussions related to the content of this paper.

1.0.1. Notation and Conventions. We assume all the schemes to be locally noetherian. We work in the
category of ﬁne log-schemes.

Deﬁnition 1.4. Let N ∈ N. For a morphism f : M → M ′ of Zp-modules, we say that f is pN -
injective (resp. pN -surjective) if its kernel (resp.
its cockernel) is annihilated by pN and we say that
f is pN -isomorphism if it is pN -injective and pN -surjective. We deﬁne in the same way the notion of
pN -distinguished triangle or pN -acyclic complex (a complex whose cohomology groups are annihilated
by pN ) as well as the notion of pN -quasi-isomorphism (map in the derived category that induces a
pN -isomorphism on cohomology).

We will use a shorthand for certain homotopy limits. Namely, if f : C → C′ is a map in the dg derived

category of abelian groups, we set

2. Syntomic cohomology

Let OK be a complete discrete valuation ring with fraction ﬁeld K of characteristic 0 and with perfect
residue ﬁeld k of characteristic p. Let ̟ be a uniformizer of OK; we will keep it ﬁxed throughout the
paper5. Let W (k) be the ring of Witt vectors of k with fraction ﬁeld F (i.e, W (k) = OF ); let e be the
ramiﬁcation index of K over F . Let σ = ϕ be the absolute Frobenius on W (k). For a OK-scheme X,
let X0 denote the special ﬁber of X and let Xn denote the reduction modulo pn of X. We will denote
0 the scheme Spec(OK) with the trivial, canonical (i.e., associated to the closed
by OK, OK
point), and (N → OK, 1 7→ 0) log-structure respectively.

×, and OK

In this section we will brieﬂy review the deﬁnitions of syntomic and syntomic-´etale cohomologies and

their basic properties. We refer the reader for details to [33, 2].

2.1. Syntomic cohomology. For a log-scheme X we denote by Xsyn the small syntomic site of X. It
is built from log-syntomic morphisms f : Y → Z in the sense of Kato [18, 2.5] (see also [7, 6.1]), i.e.,
the morphism f is integral, the underlying morphism of schemes is ﬂat and locally of ﬁnite presentation,
i
֒→ W h→ Z where h is log-smooth and i is an exact

and, ´etale locally on Y , there is a factorization Y
closed immersion that is transversally regular over Z.

For a log-scheme X log-syntomic over Spec(W (k)), deﬁne

In the same way we can deﬁne syntomic sheaves Sn(r) on Xm,syn for m ≥ n. Abusing notation, we
set Sn(r) = i∗Sn(r) for the natural map i : Xm,syn → Xsyn. Since i∗ is exact, H ∗(Xm,syn, Sn(r)) =
H ∗(Xsyn, Sn(r)). Because of that we will write Sn(r) for the syntomic sheaves on Xm,syn as well as on
Xsyn. We will also need the ”undivided” version of syntomic complexes of sheaves:

Proposition 2.1. ([8, Prop. 3.12]) For X a ﬁne and saturated log-smooth log-scheme over OK and
0 ≤ r ≤ p − 2, the natural map of complexes of sheaves on the ´etale site of X0

is a quasi-isomorphism. For X semistable over OK

2.1.1. Syntomic cohomology and diﬀerential forms. Let X be a syntomic scheme over W (k). Recall the
diﬀerential deﬁnition [16] of syntomic cohomology. Assume ﬁrst that we have an immersion ι : X ֒→ Z
over W (k) such that Z is a smooth W (k)-scheme endowed with a compatible system of liftings of the
Frobenius {Fn : Zn → Zn}. Let Dn = DXn (Zn) be the PD-envelope of Xn in Zn (compatible with the
canonical PD-structure on pWn(k)) and JDn the ideal of Xn in Dn. Set J <r>

are, up to canonical quasi-isomorphisms, independent of the choice of ι and {Fn} (and we will omit the
subscript Z from the notation). Again, the natural maps ω : S′
n(r)X
have kernels and cokernels annihilated by pr.

n(r)X → Sn(r)X and τ : Sn(r)X → S′

In general, immersions as above exist ´etale locally, and we deﬁne Sn(r)X ∈ D+(X´et, Z/pn) by gluing

the local complexes. We deﬁne S′

n(r)X in a similar way.

Let now X be a log-syntomic scheme over W (k). Using log-crystalline cohomology, the above con-
struction of syntomic complexes goes through almost verbatim (see [33, 2.1] for details) to yield the
logarithmic analogs Sn(r) and S′
n(r) on X´et. In this paper we are often interested in log-schemes com-
ing from a regular syntomic scheme X over W (k) and a relative simple (i.e., with no self-intersections)
normal crossing divisor D on X. In such cases we will write Sn(r)X (D) and S′
n(r)X (D) for the syntomic
complexes and use the Zariski topology instead of the ´etale one.

2.1.2. Products. We need to discuss products. Assume that we are in the lifted situation (2.2). Then we
have a product structure

∪ : S′

n(r)X,Z ⊗ S′

n(r′)X,Z → S′

n(r + r′)X,Z ,

r, r′ ≥ 0,

deﬁned by the following formulas

6A scheme X over OK is called semistable if it is surjective on Spec OK , regular, and there is a distinguished divisor
”at inﬁnity” D∞ which is a strict relative normal crossing divisor and which together with the special ﬁber forms a strict
normal crossing divisor.

This product is clearly compatible with the crystalline product.

deﬁned by the formulas

This product is also clearly compatible with the crystalline product.

The above product structures are compatible with the maps ω. On the other hand the maps τ are, in

general, not compatible with products.

2.1.3. Symbol maps. Let X be a regular syntomic scheme over W (k) with a divisor D with relative simple
normal crossings. Recall that there are symbol maps deﬁned by Kato and Tsuji [33, 2.2]

SYNTOMIC COHOMOLOGY AND p-ADIC MOTIVIC COHOMOLOGY

The symbol maps (2.3) for general r are obtained from r = 1 using the product structure on syntomic
cohomology.

2.2. Syntomic-´etale cohomology. We will now recall the deﬁnition and basic properties of syntomic-
´etale cohomology. Let X be a log-scheme, log-syntomic over Spec(W (k)). We will need the logarithmic
version of the syntomic-´etale site of Fontaine-Messing [9]. We say that a morphism Z → Y of p-adic
formal log-schemes over Spf(W (k)) is (small) log-syntomic if every Zn → Yn is (small) log-syntomic. For
a formal log-scheme Z the syntomic-´etale site Zs´e is deﬁned by taking as objects morphisms f : Y → Z
that are small log-syntomic and have log-´etale generic ﬁber. This last condition means that, ´etale locally
g
on Y, f has a factorization Y i→ X
→ Z with X aﬃne, i an exact closed immersion, and g log-smooth
such that the map F ⊗W (k) Γ(Y, I/I 2) → F ⊗W (k) Γ(Y, i∗Ω1
X /Z) is an isomorphism, where I is the ideal
of OX deﬁning Y. For a log-scheme Z, we also have the syntomic-´etale site Zs´e. Here the objects are
morphisms U → Z that are small log-syntomic with the generic ﬁber UK log-´etale over ZK.

Let bX be the p-adic completion of X. Let i : Xn,´et → X´et and j : Xtr,K,´et → X´et be the natural maps.

Here Xtr is the open set of X where the log-structure is trivial. We have the following commutative
diagram of maps of topoi

Assume ﬁrst that 0 ≤ r ≤ p − 2. Abusively, let Sn(r) denote also the direct image of Sn(r) under

the canonical morphism Xn,syn → bXs´e. By [9, III.5], for j′ : Xtr,K,´et → XK,s´e, there is a canonical

2.2.1. Syntomic complexes and p-adic nearby cycles. For log-schemes over O×
K, in a stable range, syntomic
cohomology tends to compute (via the period morphism) p-adic nearby cycles . We will brieﬂy recall the
relevant theorems. For 0 ≤ r ≤ p − 2, there is a natural homomorphism on the ´etale site of Xn

αr : Sn(r) → i∗Rj∗Z/pn(r).

To deﬁne it, we apply Rbε∗ to the map Sn(r) → i∗

above and get

∗Z/pn(r) induced from the map αr described

∗Z/pn(r) = i∗Rj∗Z/pn(r).

The ﬁrst equality follows from the fact that the morphism Xn,syn → bXs´e is exact [9, III.4.1]. The second

equality was proved in [19, 2.5], [32, 5.2.3]. One checks that αr is compatible with products.

Similarly, for any r ≥ 0, we get a natural map

If K has enough roots of unity then the kernel and cokernel of this map are annihilated by pN r for a
universal constant N (not depending on p, X, K, n or r). In general, the kernel and cokernel of this map
are annihilated by pN for an integer N = N (e, p, r), which depends on e, r, but not on X or n.

2.2.2. Syntomic-´etale cohomology. Recall [9, III.4.4], [32, 5.2.2] that the functor F 7→ (i∗

r ≥ 0.

Remark 2.4. The syntomic-´etale complexes En(r) that we described here are the same (in the derived
category) as those deﬁned by Fontaine-Messing in [9, 5] in the case when Xtr = X but diﬀer from those
deﬁned by Tsuji in [32, 5.2] in the general situation. More speciﬁcally, we have

2.2.3. Syntomic-´etale cohomology and ´etale cohomology of the generic ﬁber. For a log-scheme over O×
K,
in a stable range, syntomic-´etale cohomology tends to compute ´etale cohomology of the generic ﬁber.

Theorem 2.5. Let X be a log-scheme log-smooth over OK
immersion. Then

(1) we have a natural quasi-isomorphism

×. Let j : Xtr ֒→ X be the natural open

˜αr : τ≤rEn(r) ≃ τ≤rRj∗Z/pn(r),

0 ≤ r ≤ p − 2.

(2) if X is semistable, there is a constant N as in Theorem 2.3 and a natural morphism

αr : E ′

n(r) → Rj∗Z/pn(r)′,

r ≥ 0,

such that the induced map on cohomology sheaves in degree q ≤ r has kernel and cokernel anni-
hilated by pN .

Proof. Assume that 0 ≤ r ≤ p−2. Consider the following commutative diagram of distinguished triangles

∗Z/pn(r) −−−−→ τ≤rRj∗Z/pn(r) −−−−→ i∗i∗τ≤rRj∗Z/pn(r)

The top triangle is distinguished because we have the distinguished triangle from (2.7) and the natural
map τ≤rSn(r) ∼→ Sn(r) is a quasi-isomorphism. The map αr is a quasi-isomorphism by the main theorem
of [34]. The ﬁrst part of the theorem follows.

For the second part consider the following commutative diagram of distinguished triangles

By [8, Theorem 1.1], the right period map αr on the level of cohomology has kernels and cokernels killed
by N for a constant N as in the theorem. Hence the same is true of the left map αr, as wanted.
(cid:3)

The above theorem implies that the logarithmic syntomic-´etale cohomology is close to the logarithmic

syntomic-´etale cohomology of the complement of the divisor at inﬁnity.

Corollary 2.6. Let X be a semistable scheme over OK with a divisor at inﬁnity D∞. We treat it is as
a log-scheme over O×

K. Let Y := X \ D∞ and let j1 : Y ֒→ X.

(1) we have a natural quasi-isomorphism

˜αr : τ≤rEn(r)X

∼→ τ≤rRj1∗En(r)Y ,

0 ≤ r ≤ p − 2.

(2) there is a constant N as in Theorem 2.3 and a natural morphism

αr : E ′

n(r)X → Rj1∗E ′

n(r)Y ,

r ≥ 0,

such that the induced map on cohomology sheaves in degree q ≤ r has kernel and cokernel anni-
hilated by pN .

Proof. Note that Xtr = YK and set j2 : YK ֒→ Y . We have j = j1j2. By Theorem 2.5, both terms in the
ﬁrst claim are quasi-isomorphic to

τ≤rRj∗Z/pn(r)Xtr = τ≤rRj2∗τ≤rRj1∗Z/pn(r)YK .

Hence they are quasi-isomorphic. The second claim of the corollary is proved in the same way.

2.2.4. Nisnevich syntomic-´etale cohomology. We will pass now to the Nisnevich topos of X. Denote by

using that Rε∗i∗ = i∗Rε∗

Moreover, the morphism H i(W (k), En(r)Nis) → H i(W (k), Sn(r)Nis) is an isomorphism.

To see the ﬁrst claim, note that we have
1−ϕ

It follows that

Sn(0)Nis = Z/pn, Sn(r)´et := Wn(k)[−1],

r ≥ 1.

0, i ≥ 0, because W (k) is henselian.

3. Syntomic cohomology and motivic cohomology

Let X be a smooth scheme over OK. Let Z(r)M denote the complex of motivic sheaves Z(r)M :=
X 7→ zr(X, 2r − ∗) in the ´etale topology of X. Let Z/pn(r)M := Z(r)M ⊗ Z/pn. Recall how the complex

zr(X, ∗) is deﬁned [3]. Denote by △n the algebraic n-simplex Spec Z[t0, . . . , tn]/(P ti − 1). Let zr(X, i)

be the free abelian group generated by closed integral subschemas of codimension r of X × △i meeting
all faces properly. Then zr(X, ∗) is the chain complex thus deﬁned with boundaries given by pullbacks
of cycles along face maps. This complex is covariant for proper morphisms (with a shift in weight and
degree) and contravariant for ﬂat morphisms.

We know that in the Zariski topology H j(XZar, Z/pn(i)M) = H jΓ(XZar, Z/pn(r)M) is the Bloch higher
Chow group [10, Theorem 3.2] and that this is also the case for the Nisnevich topology [10, Prop. 3.6].
Locally, in the ´etale topology, when p is invertible, the ´etale cycle class map deﬁnes a quasi-isomorphism
Z/pn(r)M ≃ Z/pn(r); when X is of characteristic p, then the logarithmic de Rham-Witt cycle class
map deﬁnes a quasi-isomorphism Z/pn(r)M ≃ WnΩr
Y,log
denotes the sheaf of logarithmic de Rham-Witt diﬀerential forms [21]. Moreover, if i : Z ֒→ X is a closed
subscheme of codimension c with open complement j : U ֒→ X then the exact sequence

X,log[−r] [11], where, for a log-scheme Y , WnΩ∗

0 → i∗Z(r − c)M,Z[−2c] → Z(r)M,X → j∗Z(r)M,U

forms a distinguished triangle in the derived category of sheaves on X∗, ∗ denoting the Zariski or Nisnevich
topology. We deﬁne motivic cohomology as

M(X, Z/pn(r)) := H ∗(XZar, Z/pn(r)M ) = H ∗(XNis, Z/pn(r)M );

H ∗
M,´et(X, Z/pn(r)) := H ∗(X´et, Z/pn(r)M ).

H ∗

SYNTOMIC COHOMOLOGY AND p-ADIC MOTIVIC COHOMOLOGY

For a smooth scheme Y over OK, we deﬁne its p-adic motivic cohomology as

H ∗

M(Y, Qp(r)) := H ∗(holimn RΓ(YZar, Z/pn(r)M) ⊗ Q) = H ∗(holimn Γ(YZar, Z/pn(r)M) ⊗ Q).

We deﬁne its ´etale version H ∗

M,´et(Y, Qp(r)) in an analogous way.

We list the following corollary of Theorem 2.5.

Corollary 3.1. Let X be a smooth variety over K. Then there exists a natural syntomic cycle class map

clsyn

i,r : H i

M(X, Qp(r)) → H i

syn(X, Qp(r)),

where the target group is the syntomic cohomology deﬁned in [22]. This map is compatible with the ´etale
cycle class map, i.e., the following diagram commutes

and by the quasi-isomorphisms j∗Z/pn(r)M
Since, by Theorem 2.5, the period map αr is a pN -quasi-isomorphism, we can deﬁne the syntomic cycle
class map clsyn
to make the above diagram commute. It induces the syntomic class map into syntomic

This concludes the construction of the ﬁrst distinguished triangle of our theorem.

For the second triangle in the theorem, take the ﬁrst triangle and push it down to the Nisnevich

Corollary 3.5. Let X be a semistable scheme over OK with a smooth special ﬁber. For a constant

n(r)X,∗ ⊕ WnΩr−1
S′

X0,log[−r] → S′

n(r)X ×,∗

It suﬃces thus to construct a section of the residue map. For r = 0 there is nothing to prove so we will
assume that r > 0.

For that, consider the following commutative diagram

where i : X0 ֒→ X1 is the natural closed immersion. Since the map i∗ : RΓcr(X1/Wn(k))ϕ=pr−1
→
RΓcr(X0/Wn(k))ϕ=pr−1
is a pN (p,e) quasi-isomorphism [8, Remark 5.9], the maps in the above diagram
induce a pN (p,e)-map RΓcr(X0/Wn(k))ϕ=pr−1
n(r)X × [1] that is a pN (p,e,r)-section of the residue map
on the scheme X0. It is natural on the ´etale site of X0 (it depends only on the uniformizer ̟) hence
gives a section on the level of sheaves that we wanted.

where, for a scheme Y over W (k), we set RΓcr(Y /F ) := RΓcr(Y /W (k))Q := holimn RΓcr(Y1/Wn(k)) ⊗ Q.
The following corollary follows immediately from Corollary 3.5.

Corollary 3.6. Let X be a semistable scheme over OK with a smooth special ﬁber. We have the following
natural quasi-isomorphisms

RΓ(X∗, S(r))Q ⊕ RΓ(X∗, W Ωr−1

X0,log)Q[−r] ∼→ RΓ(X ×

∗ , S(r))Q.

Corollary 3.7. Let X be a semistable scheme over OK with a smooth special ﬁber. For a constant N as
in Theorem 2.3, we have the following pN -distinguished triangle of sheaves in the ´etale topology of X0

(3.8)

n(r)X → τ≤ri∗Rj∗Z/pn(r)′ → WnΩr−1

X0,log[−r].

Moreover, for a constant N = N (p, e, r) we have the following pN -quasi-isomorphism

n(r)X ⊕ WnΩr−1
S′

X0,log[−r] → τ≤ri∗Rj∗Z/pn(r)′.

Proof. This immediately follows from Theorem 3.2, Theorem 2.3, and Corollary 3.5.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.8. For r ≤ p − 2, the distinguished triangle (3.8) was constructed before by Kurihara. No
additional constants are needed in this case.

Theorem 3.9. ([20, 1]) Let X be a smooth scheme over OK. For r ≤ p − 2, we have the following
distinguished triangle of sheaves in the ´etale topology of X0

Sn(r)X → τ≤ri∗Rj∗Z/pn(r) → WnΩr−1

X0,log[−r].

It is easy to see that the above theorem holds also for schemes X that are semistable over OK with a

smooth special ﬁber, i.e., that we have the following distinguished triangle

Sn(r)X → τ≤ri∗Rj∗Z/pn(r) → WnΩr−1

X0,log[−r],

r ≤ p − 2.

Indeed, it suﬃces to note that all the terms involved have Gysin sequences [34] and to use the above
theorem. In particular, in view of Theorem 2.2, we have the following distinguished triangle

Sn(r)X → Sn(r)X × → WnΩr−1

X0,log[−r],

r ≤ p − 2,

a ”small twists” analog of the distinguished triangles from Theorem 3.2.

3.2. Syntomic cohomology and motivic cohomology. The main theorem of this section shows that,
in ´etale topology, syntomic-´etale complexes on smooth schemes over OK approximate motivic complexes.

Theorem 3.10. Let X be a semistable scheme over OK with a smooth special ﬁber. Let j′ : Xtr ֒→ X
be the natural open immersion. Then

(1) there is a natural cycle class map

clsyn

r

It is a pN -quasi-isomorphism for a constant N as in Theorem 2.3.

We have analogous statements in the ´etale topology. These cycle class maps are compatible (via the
localization map and the period map) with the ´etale cycle class maps.

symbol map i∗Rrj∗Z/pn(r) → WnΩr−1
X0,log. The latter is deﬁned by observing that i∗Rrj∗Z/pn(r) is
locally generated by symbols {f1, . . . , fr} for fi ∈ i∗j∗O∗
[5, Cor. 6.1.1]. By multilinearity, each
symbol can be written as a sum of symbols of the form {f1, . . . , fr} and {f1, . . . , fr−1, ̟} for fi ∈ i∗O∗

Then κ sends the former to zero and the latter to dlog[f 1] ∧ · · · ∧ dlog[f r−1] where f i is the reduction of

We claim that the right square of the diagram pN -commutes for a constant as in the statement of

It follows that the left vertical map in the diagram 3.10 exists. It is unique because

Hom(E ′

n(r)X,Nis, WnΩr−1

X0,log[−r − 1]) = 0

for degree reasons. It is clearly a quasi-isomorphism. All of the above has to be taken in the pN -sense.

It remains now to show that there exists a pN r-quasi-isomorphism Z/pn(r)M → Cn(r), for a universal
constant N . We proceed as in [10, p. 14]. Consider the following diagram of distinguished triangles (the
complex C′

The middle and the right vertical maps are induced by the ´etale and the logarithmic de Rham-Witt cycle
class map, respectively. They are quasi-isomorphisms by the Beilinson -Lichtenbaum Conjecture. The
right square commutes: pass to the ´etale site and there this fact was shown in [10, p. 14]. Hence the left
vertical map exists, is unique, and a quasi-isomorphism as well. This concludes the proof of our theorem.

Corollary 3.14. Let X be a proper semistable scheme over OK with a smooth special ﬁber. Then the

Proof. The ﬁrst claim follows from Corollary 3.13 by passing to limit over ﬁnite extensions of K in K.
The fact that the localization map j∗ is an isomorphism was proved in [24, Lemma 3.1].
(cid:3)

Remark 3.15. For X proper the above diagram was studied in [24] (see [26] for a brief survey): it was
constructed ﬁrst for the Chern classes from p-adic K-theory and then for motivic cohomology by studying
compatibility of Chern classes with operations on K-theory. This did not use the Fontaine-Messing period
map αi,r but instead a period map αi,r : H i
´et(XK,tr, Qp(r)) → H i(XOK , S(r))Q was deﬁned using the
above diagram. The fact that it is an isomorphism followed from the proof of the Crystalline Conjecture
and implied that so is the syntomic cycle class map clsyn
i,r .

For an open X as above, the situation is, at the moment, reversed. We deﬁned log-syntomic p-adic

Chern classes [28] using the (universal) syntomic cycle class maps constructed in this paper.

Corollary 3.16. Let X be a smooth scheme over OK. Let N denote the constant from Corollary 3.5.
There exists a natural morphism

(3.12)

H ∗−1

M (X0, Z/pn(r − 1)) ⊕ H ∗

M(X, Z/pn(r)) → H ∗

M(XK, Z/pn(r))

whose kernel and cokernel are annihilated by pN . Hence we have a natural isomorphism

(3.13)

H ∗−1

M (X0, Qp(r − 1)) ⊕ H ∗

M(X, Qp(r)) ≃ H ∗

M(XK , Qp(r)).

Proof. Follows from Corollary 3.7 and the distinguished triangle (3.9) from the proof of Theorem 3.10. (cid:3)

Remark 3.17. Let ℓ be a prime diﬀerent than p. Then there exist analogs of the maps (3.12) and (3.13),
and they are isomorphisms. To see this, it suﬃces to show that the following diagram of complexes of
sheaves on the Nisnevich site commutes.

The bottom sequence is the localization distinguished triangle in motivic cohomology. The class [̟] :
Z → Z/ℓn(1)M [1] corresponds to the class of ̟ in H 1
M (K, Z/ℓn(1)). The pullback map i∗ is a quasi-
isomorphism by rigidity [3, Lemma 11.1]. The diagram commutes because the localization triangle is
Z/ℓ(∗)M -equivariant.

Appendix A. Comparison of crystalline, convergent, and rigid syntomic cohomologies

We will compare crystalline, convergent, and rigid syntomic cohomologies for smooth schemes over OK
with normal crossing compactiﬁcations. Let X be a smooth scheme over OK. Recall Besser’s deﬁnition
of rigid syntomic cohomology [2]

RΓrig

syn(X, r) := [RΓrig(X0/F ) ⊕ F rRΓdR(XK)

−−→RΓrig(X0/F ) ⊕ RΓrig(X0/K)],

r ≥ 0.

f

Here RΓrig(·) denotes the rigid cohomology and f : (x, y) 7→ ((pr − ϕ)(x), sp(y) − x), where sp is the
Berthelot’s specialization map.

Proposition A.1. Let X be a proper semistable scheme over OK with a smooth special ﬁber. There is
a natural quasi-isomorphism

RΓrig

syn(Xtr, r) ≃ RΓsyn(X, r),

r ≥ 0.

Proof. As usual we consider X as a log-scheme. We can write

RΓrig

syn(Xtr, r) ≃ [RΓrig(X0,tr/F )ϕ=pr

→ RΓrig(X0,tr)/F rRΓdR(XK,tr)]

Since we have

RΓsyn(X, r) ≃ [RΓcr(X/F )ϕ=pr

→ RΓdR(XK)/F r],

it suﬃces to construct a map

RΓcr(X/F ) → RΓrig(X0,tr/F )

that is compatible (in the dg category sense) with Frobenius and the specialization map from de Rham
cohomology. This is accomplished by the following commutative diagram.

RΓcr(X1/F )

Here RΓconv(·) denotes the (logarithmic) convergent cohomology [23, 1, 30] that is used classically to
connect rigid cohomology with crystalline cohomology. The quasi-isomorphisms between the rigid and
the convergent cohomology at the bottom of the diagram are proved in [30, Cor. 2.4.13]. The maps i∗
are quasi-isomorphisms by invariance of convergent cohomology under nilpotent thickenings [1, 1.14.3].
The map α0 is a quasi-isomorphism by [30, Theorem 3.1.1]. The top map i∗ is a quasi-isomorphism on
ϕ-eigenspaces [8, Remark 5.9]; hence so is the map α1,F . The quasi-isomorphisms σcr, σconv are simply the
crystalline and the convergent [30, 2.3] Poincar´e Lemmas, respectively. It follows that the specialization
map sp as well as the map α1,K are quasi-isomorphisms as well.
(cid:3)

Remark A.2. Recall that Besser’s deﬁnition of rigid syntomic cohomology is modeled on the deﬁnition
of convergent syntomic cohomology [25]. In its logarithmic form the latter is deﬁned as the following
mapping ﬁber

RΓconv

syn (X, r) := [RΓconv(X0/F )ϕ=pr

→ RΓconv(X0/K)/F rRΓconv(X0/K)]

The proof of the above proposition shows that, for a proper and semistable scheme over OK with a
smooth special ﬁber, we have natural quasi-isomorphisms

(A.1)

RΓrig

syn(Xtr, r) ≃ RΓconv

syn (X, r) ≃ RΓsyn(X, r),

r ≥ 0.

In the proper case this was shown in [2, Prop. 9.8].

VERONIKA ERTL AND WIES LAWA NIZIO L

For a variety Y over K, let RΓN N

syn (Y, r) denote the syntomic cohomology deﬁned in [22].

Corollary A.3. Let X be a proper semistable scheme over OK with a smooth special ﬁber. There is a
natural distinguished triangle

X0,log)Q[−r] ∼→ RΓN N
Proof. Since we have a canonical quasi-isomorphism [22, Prop. 3.18]

syn(Xtr, r) ⊕ RΓ(W Ωr−1

RΓrig

syn (XK,tr, r).

this follows immediately from Proposition A.1 and Corollary 3.6.
