OSAMU IYAMA, KIRIKO KATO AND JUN-ICHI MIYACHI

Abstract. We study a structure of subcategories which are called a poly-
gon of recollements in a triangulated category. First, we study a 2n-gon of
recollements in an (m/n)-Calabi-Yau triangulated category. Second, we show
the homotopy category K(MorN−1(B)) of complexes of an additive category
MorN−1(B) of N −1 sequences of split monomorphisms of an additive category
B has a 2N -gon of recollments. Third, we show the homotopy category KN (B)
of N -complexes of B has also a 2N -gon of recollments. Finally, we show there
is a triangle equivalence between K(MorN−1(B)) and KN (B).

0. Introduction

The notion of recollement of triangulated categories was introduced by Beilinson,
Bernstein and Deligne in connection with derived categories of sheaves of topological
spaces ([BBD]). One of the authors introduced the notion of stable t-structure in a
triangulated category [Mi], and studied relations to recollements. Afterwards this
notion was studied by many authors under a lot of names, e.g. a torsion pair, a
semiorthogonal decomposition, Bousﬁeld localization.

Deﬁnition 0.1. Let D be a triangulated category with the translation functor Σ.
A pair (U, V) of full subcategories of D is called a stable t-structure in D provided
that

(a) U = ΣU and V = ΣV.
(b) HomD(U, V) = 0.
(c) For every X ∈ D, there exists a triangle U → X → V → ΣU with U ∈ U

and V ∈ V.

In [IKM1], we introduced the notion of polygons of recollements in a triangu-
lated category, and studied the properties of triangle of recollements in connection
with the homotopy category of unbounded complexes with bounded homologies, its
quotient category by the homotopy category of bounded complexes, and the stable
category of Cohen-Macaulay modules over an Iwanaga-Gorenstein ring. Moreover,
we studied derived categories DN (A) of N -complexes of an abelian category A,
and showDN (A) is a triangle equivalent to the derived category D(MorN −1(A)) of
ordinary complexes over an abelian category MorN −1(A) of N − 1 sequences of
morphisms of A ([IKM2]). In this article, we study the properties of polygons of
recollements in various categories.

Deﬁnition 0.2. Let D be a triangulated category, and let U1, · · · , Un be full tri-
angulated subcategories of D. An n-tuple (U1, U2, · · · , Un) is called an n-gon of
recollements in D if (Ui, Ui+1) is a stable t-structure in D (1 ≤ i ≤ n), where
U1 = Un+1.

In Section 1, we recall the notions of stable t-structures and recollement polygons

of recollements in a triangulated category.

Proposition 0.3 (Proposition 1.7). Let D1, D2 be triangulated categories. Let
(U1, · · · , Un) and (V1, · · · , Vn) be n-gons of recollements in D1 and D2, respectively.
Assume a triangle functor F : D1 → D2 sends (U1, · · · , Un) to (V1, · · · , Vn). If F |Ut
and F |Ut+1 are triangle equivalences for some t, so is F .

In Section 1, we study stable t-structures with relation to relations to contravari-

antly ﬁnite categories and Calabi-Yau triangulated categories.

Proposition 0.4 (Proposition 2.5). Let D be an (m/n)-Calabi-Yau triangulated
category. For any functorially ﬁnite thick subcategory U1 of D, we put Ui+1 := U ⊥
i
for any i. Then we have an l-gon (U1, · · · , Ul) of recollements in D for some positive
divisor l of 2n.

In Section 3, we constructs polygons of recollements in the derived derived cate-
gory of modules over an algebra, and them in the stable category of Cohen-Mcaulay
modules over an Iwanaga-Gorenstein ring.

Theorem 0.5 (Theorem 3.6). Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra of ﬁnite
global dimension such that A/JA is separable over a ﬁeld k and Db(mod A) is (m/n)-
Calabi-Yau. Let R be a coherent k-algebra of ﬁnite self-injective dimension as both
sides. For any functorially ﬁnite thick subcategory U1 of Db(mod A), we put Ui+1 :=
U ⊥
for any i. Then there is a positive divisor l of 2n such that we have an l-gon
i
(U R
l ))
of recollements in CM(R ⊗k A)

l ) of recollements in Db(mod R⊗k A) and an l-gon (Q(U R

1 ), · · · , Q(U R

1 , · · · , U R

In Section 4, we the homotopy category K(Morsm

N−1(B)) of the category Morsm

N −1(B)

of N − 1 sequences of split monomorphisms in an additive category B.

Theorem 0.6 (Theorem 4.8). Let B be an additive category. Then there is a
2N -gon of recollements in K(Morsm

N −1(B)):

(F [1,N−1], E [2,N−1], E 1, F [1,2], · · · , E s, F [s,s+1], · · · , E N−2, F [N−2,N−1], E N−1, E [1,N−2])

In Section 5, we study the homotopy category KN (B) of N -complexes of objects

of an additive category B.

In Section 6, we construct a triangle functor F N : K(Morsm

which sends the above 2N -gon of KN (B) to the above 2N -gon of KN (B). Therefore
we have the result.

Theorem 0.9 (Theorem 6.8). Let B be an additive category, then we have triangle
equivalences:

K♯(Morsm

where ♯ = nothing, −, +, b.

1. Stable t-structures and recollements

We recall the notion of recollements and study their relationship with stable
t-structures. This correspondence enables us to understand (co)localizations and
recollements by way of subcategories instead of quotient categories. In Proposition
1.2 we see that a recollement corresponds to two consecutive stable t-structures.
First we see that a (co)localization and a stable t-structure essentially describe the
same phenomenon, using the methods which are similar to ones in recollements
[BBD].

Next we recall the notion of a recollement which consists of a localization and a

colocalization.

Deﬁnition 1.1 ([BBD]). We call a diagram

D′

i∗
i∗

i!

/ D

j∗

/ D′′

of triangulated categories and functors a recollement if it satisﬁes the following:

(1) i∗, j!, and j∗ are fully faithful.
(2) (i∗, i∗), (i∗, i!), (j!, j∗), and (j∗, j∗) are adjoint pairs.
(3) there are canonical embeddings Im j! ֒→ Ker i∗, Im i∗ ֒→ Ker j∗, and

Im j∗ ֒→ Ker i! which are equivalences.

We remember that a recollement corresponds to a pair of consecutive stable

t-structures.

Proposition 1.2 ([Mi]).

(1) Let

be a recollement. Then (U, V) and (V, W) are stable t-structures in D where
we put U = Im j!, V = Im i∗ and W = Im j∗.

(2) Let (U, V) and (V, W) be stable t-structures in D. Then for the canonical

embedding i∗ : V → D, there is a recollement

V

such that Im j! = U and Im j∗ = W.

In each cases, for every object X of D adjunction arrows of adjoints induce

triangles

i∗i!X → X → j∗j∗X → Σi∗i!X,
j!j∗X → X → i∗i∗X → Σj!j∗X.

Thirdly, we introduce the notion of a polygon of recollements.

Deﬁnition 1.3. Let D be a triangulated category, and let U1, · · · , Un be full tri-
angulated subcategories of D. We call (U1, U2, · · · , Un) an n-gon of recollements in
D if (Ui, Ui+1) is a stable t-structure in D (1 ≤ i ≤ n), where U1 = Un+1.

An n-gon of recollements results in strong symmetry, and it induces three rec-

ollements as the name suggests.

Proposition 1.4 ([IKM1]). Let D be a triangulated category. Then (U1, · · · , Un)
is an n-gon of recollements in D if and only if there is a recollement

Ut

i∗
t
it∗

/ D

/ D/Ut

such that the essential image Im jt! is Ut−1, and that the essential image Im jt∗ is
Ut+1 for any t mod n. In this case all the relevant subcategories Ut and the quotient
categories D/Ut are triangle equivalent.

Finally we study the case that triangle functors preserve localizations, colocal-

izations or recollements, etc.

Deﬁnition 1.5. Let D1 and D2 be triangulated categories and let F : D1 → D2
be a triangle functor.

(1) Let (Un, Vn) be a stable t-structure in Dn (n = 1, 2). We say that F sends

(U1, V1) to (U2, V2) if F (U1) is contained in U2 and F (V1) is in V2.

(2) Let (Uin, · · · , Uin) be an n-gon of recollements in Di (i = 1, 2). We say that
F sends (U1n, · · · , U1n) to (U2n, · · · , U2n) if F (U1k) is contained in U2k for
any k.

Lemma 1.6 ([IKM1]). If a triangle functor F : D1 → D2 sends a stable t-structure
(U1, V1) in D1 to a stable t-structure (U2, V2) in D2. Then we have the following:

(1) If F |U1 is full (resp., faithful), then HomD1 (U, X) → HomD2(F U, F X) is

surjective (resp., injective) for U ∈ U1 and X ∈ D1.

(2) If F |V1 is full (resp., faithful), then HomD1(X, V ) → HomD2(F X, F V ) is

surjective (resp., injective) for X ∈ D1 and V ∈ V1.

(3) If F is full and F |U1: U1 → U2 and F |V1 : V1 → V2 are dense, then F is

dense.

Proposition 1.7. Let D1, D2 be triangulated categories. Let (U1, · · · , Un) and
(V1, · · · , Vn) be n-gons of recollements in D1 and D2, respectively. Assume a tri-
angle functor F : D1 → D2 sends (U1, · · · , Un) to (V1, · · · , Vn). Then the following
hold.

(1) In the case that n is odd, if F |Ut is fully faithful (equivalent) for some t,

so is F .

(2) In the case that n is even, if F |Ut and F |Ut+1 are fully faithful (equivalent)

for some t, so is F .

Proof. By Lemma 1.6.

(cid:3)

2. Contravariantly finite subcategories and Stable t-structures

In this section let k be a ﬁeld and D := Homk(−, k). The concept of stable
t-structures is closely related to functorially ﬁnite subcategories [AS].
If (U, V)
is a stable t-structure of D, then clearly U (resp., V) is a contravariantly (resp.,
covariantly) ﬁnite subcategory of D. We shall show that a certain converse of this
statement holds. For a full subcategory U of D, we put

U ⊥ := {T ∈ D | HomD(U, T ) = 0},
⊥U := {T ∈ D | HomD(T, U) = 0}.

Recall that an additive category is called Krull-Schmidt if any object is isomorphic
to a ﬁnite direct sum of objects whose endomorphism rings are local.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let C be an additive category, and U its full subcategory. For an
f
−→ X with UX ∈ U is called a right U-approximation
object X of C, a morphism UX
if HomC(U, f ) : HomC(U, UX ) → HomC(U, X) is surjective for any U ∈ U. More-
f
−→ X is called minimal if g is an isomorphism
over, a right U-approximation UX
whenever g : UX → UX satisﬁes f ◦ g = f .

A full subcategory U is called a contravariantly ﬁnite subcategory if every object
X of C has a right a U-approximation. A left a U-approximation and a covariantly
ﬁnite subcategory are deﬁned dually. U is called a functorially ﬁnite subcategory if
it is contravariantly ﬁnite and covariantly ﬁnite.

Proposition 2.2. Let D be a Krull-Schmidt triangulated category. For any con-
travariantly (resp., covariantly) ﬁnite thick subcategory U of D, we have a stable
t-structure (U, U ⊥) (resp., (⊥U, U)) in D.

Proof. This is a consequence of Wakamatsu-type Lemma (see [IY, Prop. 3.6] for
example). For the convenience of the reader, we give the proof here. Since D is
Krull-Schmidt category and U is closed under direct summands, for any object X
f
−→ X is a minimal
of D there is a triangle UX
right U-approximation. For any morphism α : U → V with U ∈ U, by octahedral

−→ V h−→ ΣUX such that UX

where all columns and rows of 4 terms are triangles. Then M belongs to U. Since f
is a right U-approximation, there is a morphism δ : M → UX such that f ◦ δ = f ′.
Then there is a morphism ǫ : Z → Σ−1V such that −Σ−1h ◦ ǫ = δ ◦ h′. Then
γ is a split monomorphism because of the minimality of f . Therefore β is a split
monomorphism, and Σ−1α and α are zero. Hence we have V ∈ U ⊥.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let D be a k-linear triangulated category such that
dimk HomD(X, Y ) < ∞ for any X, Y ∈ D. An autofunctor S : D → D is called a
Serre functor [BK, RV] if there exists a functorial isomorphism

HomD(X, Y ) ≃ D HomD(Y, SX)

for any X, Y ∈ D.

We say that D is (m/n)-Calabi-Yau for a positive integer n and an integer m if

we have an isomorphism Sn ≃ Σm of functors 1.

Immediately we have the following.

Lemma 2.4. Let D be a Krull-Schmidt triangulated category with a Serre functor
S. Then the following hold.

(1) U ⊥ = ⊥(SU) for any subcategory U of D.
(2) If (U, V) is a stable t-structure and U is functorially ﬁnite in D, then

(V, SU) is a stable t-structure and V is functorially ﬁnite in D.

Proof. (1) Immediate from the deﬁnition of Serre functor.

(2) We have ⊥(SU) = U ⊥ = V by (1). Since SU is a covariantly ﬁnite subcategory
of D, we have that (V, SU) is a stable t-structure by the dual of Proposition 2.2.
Consequently V is a functorially ﬁnite subcategory of D by Proposition 2.2.
(cid:3)

Proposition 2.5. Let D be an (m/n)-Calabi-Yau triangulated category. For any
functorially ﬁnite thick subcategory U1 of D, we put Ui+1 := U ⊥
for any i. Then we
i
have an l-gon (U1, · · · , Ul) of recollements in D for some positive divisor l of 2n.

Proof. By Propositions 2.2, we have a stable t-structure (U1, U2) in D. Using
Lemma 2.4(2) inductively, we have a stable t-structure (Ui, Ui+1) in D such that
Ui+2 = SUi for any i. We have the statement because of Sn ≃ Σm.
(cid:3)

3. Constructions of Stable t-structures

In this section, we investigate polygons of recollements in derived categories and

in stable module categories.

For a ring R, we denote by Mod R (resp., mod R) the category of right (resp.,
ﬁnitely generated right) R-modules, and denote by Proj R (resp., Inj R, proj R) the
full subcategory of Mod R consisting of projective (resp., injective, ﬁnitely generated
projective) modules. For right (resp., left) R-module MR (resp., RN ), we denote
by idim MR (resp., idim RN ) the injective dimension of MR (resp., RN ), and by
pdim MR (resp., pdim RN ) the projective dimension of MR (resp., RN ). For A be
an abelian category and its addtive subcategory B. we denote by Db(A) (resp.,
Kb(B) the derived category (resp., the homotopy category) of bounded complexes
of objects of A (resp., B).

Deﬁnition 3.1. We call a ring R Iwanaga-Gorenstein if it is Noetherian with
idimR R < ∞ and idim RR < ∞ [Iw]. We deﬁne the category of Cohen-Macaulay
R-modules 2 and the category of large Cohen-Macaulay R-modules by

CM R := {X ∈ mod R | Exti
LCM R := {X ∈ Mod R | Exti

R(X, R) = 0 (i > 0)},
R(X, Proj R) = 0 (i > 0)}.

Then CM R forms a Frobenius category with the subcategory proj R of projective-
injective objects, and the stable category CMR forms a triangulated category [Ha].
By [IKM1] there exist triangle equivalences

CMR ≃ Db(mod R)/ Kb(proj R),

LCMR ≃ Db(Mod R)/ Kb(Proj R).

For subcategories U and V of a triangulated category D, we put

U ∗ V := {X ∈ D | U → X → V → ΣU is a triangle in D (U ∈ U, V ∈ V)}.

By octahedral axiom, we have (U ∗ V) ∗ W = U ∗ (V ∗ W).

Lemma 3.2. Let D be a triangulated subcategory, and U and V triangulated (resp.,
thick) subcategories of D satisfying HomD(U, V) = 0. Then U ∗ V is a triangulated
(resp., thick) subcategory of D.

Proof. We only have to show (U ∗ V) ∗ (U ∗ V) ⊂ U ∗ V. Since HomD(U, ΣV) = 0,
we have V ∗ U = add{U, V}. Thus we have (U ∗ V) ∗ (U ∗ V) = U ∗ (V ∗ U) ∗ V =
U ∗ add{U, V} ∗ V ⊂ (U ∗ U) ∗ (V ∗ V) = U ∗ V, where add{U, V} is the additive
subcategory of consisting of ﬁnite direct sums of objects of U and V. Thus U ∗ V
is a triangulated subcategory of D. If U and V are closed under direct summand,
then so is U ∗ V (e.g. [IY, Prop. 2.1]). Thus the assertion for thick subcategories
follows.
(cid:3)

Let A and R be k-algebras. For a subcategory U of Db(mod A), we denote by

U R the thick subcategory of Db(mod R ⊗k A) generated by
{L ⊗k X | L ∈ Db(mod R), X ∈ U}.

The following observation gives us a lot of examples of stable t-structures in derived
categories.

2 In the representation theory of orders [CR, Au, Y], there is another notion of Cohen-Macaulay
modules which generalizes the classical notion in commutative ring theory. These two concepts
coincide for Gorenstein orders.

8

OSAMU IYAMA, KIRIKO KATO AND JUN-ICHI MIYACHI

Proposition 3.3. Let R be a k-algebra and A a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra such
that A/JA is a separable k-algebra, where JA is the Jacobson radical. For any
stable t-structure (U, V) in Db(mod A), we have a stable t-structure (U R, V R) in
Db(mod R ⊗k A).
Proof. Let D := Db(mod R ⊗k A). Since

HomD(L ⊗k U, M ⊗k V ) = HomDb(mod R)(L, M ) ⊗k HomDb(mod A)(U, V )

for any L, M ∈ Db(mod R) and any U, V ∈ Db(mod A), we have HomD(U R, V R) =
0.

A/M J i+1

Since U R ∗ V R is a thick subcategory of D by Lemma 3.2, we only have to show
U R ∗ V R contains mod R ⊗k A. Any R ⊗k A-module M is ﬁltered by R ⊗k A-
modules M J i
A which are semisimple A-modules. We only have to show
that any R ⊗k A-module N which is a semisimple A-modules belongs to U R ∗ V R.
Since the map (A/JA) ⊗k (A/JA) → A/JA, x ⊗ y 7→ xy is a split epimorphism
of Aop ⊗k A-modules, we have that the map N ⊗k (A/JA) → N , n ⊗ y 7→ ny
is a split epimorphism of R ⊗k A-modules. Since A/JA ∈ U ∗ V, we have that
N ⊗k (A/JA) ∈ U R ∗ V R. Thus N ∈ U R ∗ V R.
(cid:3)

The following result gives a criterion for a stable t-structure in the derived cat-

egory to give a stable t-structure in the stable category.

Lemma 3.4 ([IKM1]). Let D be a triangulated category, C a thick subcategory of
D, and Q : D → D/C the canonical quotient [Ne]. For a stable t-structure (U, V) in
D, the following are equivalent, where Q(U) is the full subcategory of D/C consisting
of objects Q(X) for X ∈ E.

(1) (Q(U), Q(V)) is a stable t-structure in D/C.
(2) (U ∩ C, V ∩ C) is a stable t-structure in C.

The following example provides us a rich source of triangulated categories with

Serre functors.

Proposition 3.5. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra of ﬁnite self-injective
dimension as both sides. Then the following hold.
(1) Kb(proj A) has a Serre functor νA := −⊗L
(2) Kb(proj A) is (m/n)-Calabi-Yau if and only if (DA)⊗L

An ≃ ΣmA in

A(DA).

Db(mod Aop ⊗k A).

We have the following main result in this section.

Theorem 3.6. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra of ﬁnite global dimension
such that A/JA is separable over k and Db(mod A) is (m/n)-Calabi-Yau. Let R
be a coherent k-algebra of ﬁnite self-injective dimension as both sides. For any
functorially ﬁnite thick subcategory U1 of Db(mod A), we put Ui+1 := U ⊥
for any i.
i
Then there is a positive divisor l of 2n such that we have an l-gon (U R
l ) of
recollements in Db(mod R ⊗k A) and an l-gon (Q(U R
l )) of recollements
in CM(R⊗k A), where Q : Db(mod R⊗k A) → CM(R⊗k A) is the canonical quotient.
Proof. According to Propositions 2.5 and 3.3, we have an n-gon (U R
2 , · · · , U R
2n)
of recollements in Db(mod R ⊗k A). Since A is of ﬁnite global dimension, there
exists a triangle

with Ui ∈ Ui ∩ Kb(proj A) and Ui+1 ∈ Ui+1 ∩ Kb(proj A). Applying R ⊗k −, we have
a triangle

R ⊗k Ui → R ⊗k A → R ⊗k Ui+1 → ΣR ⊗k Ui
i ∩ Kb(proj R ⊗k A) and R ⊗k Ui+1 ∈ U R

with R ⊗k Ui ∈ U R
Lemma 3.4, we have a stable t-structure (Q(U R

i+1 ∩ Kb(proj R ⊗k A). By

i ), Q(U R

i+1)) in CM(R ⊗k A).

(cid:3)

We have the following example of recollements by [Mi, Cor. 5.11].

Proposition 3.7. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional k-algebra, and e an idempotent
of A. Assume that Exti
A(A/AeA, A/AeA) = 0 (i > 0), pdim A(AeA) < ∞ and
pdim(AeA)A < ∞. Then we have a recollement

In particuler, (Im je!, Im i∗

4. Recollement of K(Morsm

N −1(B))

In this section we study the properties of complexes of the category of N − 1
sequences of morphisms in an additive category B. Throughout this section B is
an additive category. Then the category C(B) of complexes of objects of B is a
Frobenius category such that its cconﬂations are short exact sequences of which
each term is a split exact sequence in B.

Deﬁnition 4.1. We deﬁne the category Morsm
quences of morphisms in B as follows.

• A morphism from X to Y is an (N − 1)-tuple f = (f 1, · · · , f N −1) of

morphisms f i : X i → Y i such that f i+1αi

X = αi+1

Y f i for 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 2.

We give technical tools to investigate the homotopy category K(Morsm

N −1(B)).

Deﬁnition 4.2. For an additive functor G : B → B′ between additive categories,
let (G ↓ 1B′ ) be a comma category, that is the category of objects G(X) α−→ Y for
X ∈ A, Y ∈ B′. We denote by (G ↓sm 1B′ ) the subcategory of (G ↓ 1B′) consisting
of objects G(X) α−→ Y , where α are split monomorphisms.

Example 4.3. For 1 ≤ r < N − 1, let G : Morr(B) → MorN −r−1(B) (resp.,
G : Morsm

N −r−1(B)) be an additive functor deﬁned by

r (B) → Morsm

G(X 1 α1

βN −r−2
−−−−−→ Y N −r−1

where Y 1 = · · · = Y N −r−1 = X r and β1 = · · · = βN −r−2 = 1X r . Then the cate-
gory (G ↓ 1MorN −r−1(B)) (resp., (G ↓sm 1MorN −r−1(B))) is equivalent to MorN −1(B)
(resp., Morsm

N −1(B)).

Deﬁnition 4.6. We deﬁne the following full triangulated subcategories of
K(Morsm

N −1(B)):

E [2,N −1] = Ker D[1]

E [1,N −2] = Ker D[N −1] E 1 = Ker D[2,N −1]

E s = Ker D[1,s−1]T Ker D[s+1,N −1] E N −1 = Ker D[1,N −2]

For 1 ≤ s < t ≤ N − 1, F [s,t] is the full triangulated subcategory of K(Morsm
consisting of objects X 1 α1
−−−−→ X N −1 such that αs = · · · = αt−1 = 1.

Immediately, we have the following.

Proposition 4.7. The following hold.

(1) A functor E⇑N −1

N −2 : K(MorN −2(B)) → K(MorN −1(B)) induces a triangle

equivalence between K(MorN −2(B)) and E [2,N −1].

(2) A functor UN −1 : K(B) → K(MorN −1(B)) induces a triangle equivalence

between K(B) and F [1,N −1].

Proof. (1) By Lemma 4.4, every complex of E [2,N −1] is isomorphic to some complex
of the form

0

/ X 2

/ · · ·

/ X N −1

Then it is easy to see that a triangle functor E⇑N −1
a triangle equivalence.
(2) Every complex of F [1,N −1] is of the form

N −2 : K(MorN −2(B)) → E [2,N −1] is

X 1

· · ·

X N −1

Then it is easy to see that a triangle functor U N −1 : K(B) → F [1,N −1] is a triangle
equivalence.

Theorem 4.8. Let B be an additive category. Then a 2N -tuple of full subcategories

(F [1,N−1], E [2,N−1], E 1, F [1,2], · · · , E s, F [s,s+1], · · · , E N−2, F [N−2,N−1], E N−1, E [1,N−2])
is a 2N -gon of recollements in K(Morsm

N −1(B)).

Proof. First, we prove HomK(Morsm
N −1(B))(X , Y) = 0, where X , Y are two successive
subcategories of the above 2N -tuple. By Example 4.3, Lemma 4.4 (2), any complex
of E [2,N −1] is isomorphic to a complex 0 → X 2 → · · · → X N −1 in K(Morsm
N −1(B)).
N −1(B))(F [1,N −1], E [2,N −1]) = 0 is easy. By Example 4.3, Lemma

4.4 (3), for any object of E 1 there is a complex X such that it is isomorphic to an
object X → C(1X ) → · · · → C(1X ) in K(Morsm

N −2(B)). Since it is easy to see

HomK(Morsm

N −1(B))(E [2,N−1], E 1) ≃ HomK(Morsm

N −2(B))(D[2,N−1](E [2,N−1]), D[2,N−1](E 1))

and

D[2,N −1](X → C(1X ) → · · · → C(1X )) = C(1X ) → · · · → C(1X )

is homotopically 0 in K(Morsm
N −1(B))(E [2,N −1], E 1) = 0. By Ex-
ample 4.3, Lemma 4.4 (2), (3), we may assume any morphism from E s to F [s,s+1]
is of the form

N −2(B)), HomK(Morsm

C(1X )

Y 1

/ · · ·

It is easy that the above morphism is null homotopic, and then
HomK(Morsm
F [s,s+1] to E s+1 is of the form

N −1(B))(E s, F [s,s+1]) = 0. Similarly, we may assume any morphism from

X 1

/ · · ·

/ X s

X s+1

/ X s+2

/ · · ·

/ X N −1

0

/ · · ·

/ 0

/ Y

/ C(1Y )

· · ·

C(1Y )

It is easy that the above morphism is null homotopic, and then
N −1(B))(F [s,s+1], E s+1) = 0. Since any complex of E N −1 is isomorphic to
HomK(Morsm
0 → · · · → 0 → X N −1, and any complex of E [1,N −2] is isomorphic to Y 1 → · · · →
Y N −2 → C(1Y N −1) in Morsm
E [1,N −2]) = 0. Since we may assume any morphism from E [1,N −2] to F [1,N −1] is of
the form

N −1(B), it is easy to see that HomK(Morsm

Y N −2

Y N −1
N −1(B)(E [1,N −2], F [1,N −1]) =

It is easy to see it is null homotopic, and then HomK(Morsm
0.
Second, we prove K(Morsm
gories of the above 2N -tuple. Let X 1 α1

N −1(B)) = X ∗ Y, where X , Y are two successive subcate-

Proof. Let T : C(Morsm

prove the statement by the following steps:

For T iX ∈ T i Morsm

it is a conﬂation in C. Therefore, FN preserves conﬂations.
Step 3. We have a functor FN : C−(Morsm

For X ∈ C−(B), we have X = lim

not hard to see that FN becomes a functor and preserves conﬂations.
Step 4. We have a functor FN : C(Morsm

Let X : · · · → X i di

commutative diagram (B) is a exact square, it is not hard to see that FN becomes
a functor and preserves conﬂations.

injective objects in CN (B).
Every projective-injective object in C(Morsm
biproduct ⊕i∈ZT i C(1Mi ) with Mi ∈ Morsm

According to Proposition 7.3, FN : C(Morsm

N −1(B)) is a direct summand of some
N −1(B). Since FN (C(1Mi )) ≃ C(1FN (Mi))

Lemma 6.9. Let D be a triangulated category, C, U full triangulated subcategories

such that CX ∈ C and UX ∈ U. Then we have a triangle equivalence

C/(C ∩ U) ≃ D/U.

Proof. Let E : C → D be the canonical embedding, Q′ : C → C/(C ∩ U), Q : D →
D/U the canonical quotients. Then there is a triangle functor F : C/(C ∩U) → D/U
such that Q ◦ E = F ◦ Q′. By the assumption, F is obviously dense. Given

where X1
s2−→ X1 → U2 → ΣC2 with U2 ∈ U. Therefore,
assumption, there is a triangle C2
F is a full dense functor. Let f : C1 → C2 be a morphism in C/(C ∩ U) such that
F (f ) = 0 in DU . Then F (f ) is represented by the diagram 6.10 where g = 0. In
the above, gs2 = 0, and then f = 0 in C/(C ∩ U). Hence F is an equivalence.

We say that A is an Ab3 category provided that it has any coproduct of objects.
Moreover, A is an Ab4 category provided that it has any coproduct of objects, and
that the coproduct of monics is monic.

Proposition 6.11. Let A be an AB4 category with enough projectives, and P the
category of projective objects, P the full subcategory of A consisting of projective
objects. Then the following hold.

(1) We have a triangle equivalence

K(Morsm

N −1(P))/ Kφ(Morsm

N −1(P)) ≃ D(MorN −1(A)).

(2) We have a triangle equivalence
KN (P)/ Kφ

N (P) ≃ DN (A).

N −1(P)) (resp., Kφ

N (P)) is the full subcategory of Here K(Morsm

Here Kφ(Morsm
N −1(P))
(resp., KN (P)) consisting of complexes (resp., N -complexes) of which all hmologies
are null.
Proof. (1) It is easy to see that Morsm
N −1(P) is the full subcategory of MorN −1(A)
consisting of projective objects, and that MorN −1(A) is an Ab4 category with
enough projectives. According to [BN], for any complex X ∈ K(MorN −1(A)), there
is a quasi-isomorphism P → X with P ∈ K(Morsm
N −1(P)). By Lemma 6.9, we have
K(Morsm
N −1(P)) ≃ D(MorN −1(A)).
(2) According to [IKM2] Theorem 2.23, for any complex X ∈ KN (A), there is a
quasi-isomorphism P → X with P ∈ KN (P). By Lemma 6.9, we have KN (P)/ Kφ
DN (A).

N −1(P))/ Kφ(Morsm

Corollary 6.12. Let A be an abelian category with enough projectives, and P the
category of projective objects. Then we have triangle equivalences

Moreover if A is an Ab4 category, then Then we have triangle equivalences:

D(MorN −1(A)) ≃ DN (A).

Proof. According to [IKM2] Lemma 4.8, we have a triangle equivalence
K−(Morsm
equivalence K−

N −1(P)) ≃ D−(MorN −1(A)). By [IKM2] Theorem 2.18, we have a triangle

7. Appendix

In this section, we give results concerning Frobenius categories. Let C be an
exact category with a collection E of exact sequences in the sense of Quillen [Qu].

f
−→ Y

g
An exact sequence 0 → X
−→ Z → 0 in E is called a conﬂation, and f and g
are called an inﬂation and a deﬂation, respectively. An additive functor F : C → C′
is called exact if it sends conﬂations in C to conﬂations in C′. An exact category C
is called a Frobenius category provided that it has enough projectives and enough
injectives, and that any object of C is projective if and only if it is injective. In this
case, the stable category C of C by projective objects is a triangulated category
(see [Ha]).

Remark 7.1. For a Frobenius category C, we treat the only case that for any
object X of C we can choose conﬂations

0 → X

uX−−→ IC(X)
uΣ−1 X−−−−→ PC(X)

vX−−→ ΣCX → 0
vΣ−1 X−−−−→ X → 0

0 → Σ−1

C X

where IC(X) and PC(X) are projective-injective objects in C. For a morphism
f : X → Y in C, we have a commutative diagram
vX /

uX /

/ IC(X)

/ ΣCX

/ 0

0

/ X

f

If

Σf

0

/ Y

uX /

/ IC(Y )

vY

/ ΣCY

/ 0

It is easy to see that Σf is uniquely determined in the stable category C. Therefore
C has a suspension functor ΣC : C → C.

x

Proposition 7.2 ([Ke] A.2 Proposition). If (C, E) is a small exact category, there
is an equivalence G : C → M onto a full subcategory M of an abelian category A
such that M is closed under extensions and that E is formed by the collection of
sequences 0 → X

g
−→ Z → 0 inducing exact sequences in A:

f
−→ Y

0 → G(X)

G(f )
−−−→ G(Y )

G(g)
−−−→ G(Z) → 0

Proposition 7.3. Let C, C′ be Frobenius categories, F : C → C′ an exact functor.
If F sends projective objects in C to projective objents in T ′, then it induces the
triangle functor F : C → C′.
Proof. For X ∈ C, since F (IC(X)), IC′ (F (X)) are projective-injective objects in C′,
we have a commutative diagram

where the diagrams on the top, the bottom, the front and the back surfaces are
commutative. Since (θY F (If ) − IF (f )θX )F (uX ) = uF (Y )F (f ) − IF (f )uF (X) = 0
there is a morphism δ : F (ΣX) → F (I(Y )) such that θY F (If )−IF (f )θX = δF (vX ).
Then we have ηY F (Σf ) − ΣF (f )ηX = vF (Y )δ, and then η

Then z′z is an isomorphism in C′. Similarly zz′ is also an isomorphism in C′, and
then z is an isomorphism in C′. Therefore we have a commutative diagram in C′:

where all vertical arrows are isomorphisms. Hence F induces a triangle functor
F : C → C′.
(cid:3)

Proposition 7.4. Let C, C′ be Frobenius categories, F : C → C′, G : C′ → C exact
functors such that F is a right adjoint of G. Then F and G induce triangle functors
F : C → C′, G : C′ → C such that F is a right adjoint of G.

Proof. Let 0 → A → B → C → 0 be a conﬂation in C, then 0 → F (A) → F (B) →
F (C) → 0 is a conﬂation in C′. For a projective-injective object P of C′, we have
an isomorphism between exact sequences:

0

0

/ HomC(P, F (A))

/ HomC(P, F (B))

/ HomC(P, F (C))

/ 0

≀

≀

≀

/ HomC(G(P ), A)

/ HomC(G(P ), B)

/ HomC(G(P ), C)

Then G(P ) is a projective-injective object in C. Similarly, if Q is a projective-
injective object of C, then F (Q) is also a projective-injective object of C′. By
Proposition 7.3, F and G induce the triangle functors F : C → C′, G : C′ → C.
Given X ∈ C′, consider a conﬂation

0 → X → I(X) → ΣX → 0

For any Y ∈ C, we have a isomorphism between exact sequences

HomC(I(X), F (Y ))

/ HomC(X, F (Y ))

/ HomC(X, F (Y ))

≀

≀

HomC(G(I(X)), Y )

/ HomC(G(X), Y )

/ HomC(G(X), Y )

/ 0

/ 0

Then we have an isomorphism HomC(X, F (−)) ≃ HomC(G(X), −). Similarly we
have an isomorphism HomC(−, F (Y )) ≃ HomC(G(−), Y ).
