MODELS OF TORSORS AND THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP

SCHEME

MARCO ANTEI AND MICHEL EMSALEM

Abstract. Given a relative faithfully ﬂat pointed scheme over the spectrum
of a discrete valuation ring X → S this paper is motivated by the study
of the natural morphism from the fundamental group scheme of the generic
ﬁber Xη to the generic ﬁber of the fundamental group scheme of X. Given
a torsor T → Xη under an aﬃne group scheme G over the generic ﬁber of
X, we address the question to ﬁnd a model of this torsor over X, focusing
in particular on the case where G is ﬁnite. We obtain partial answers to this
question, showing for instance that, when X is integral and regular of relative
dimension 1, such a model exists on some model of Xη obtained by performing
a ﬁnite number of N´eron blow-ups along a closed subset of the special ﬁber of
X. In the ﬁrst part we show that the relative fundamental group scheme of
X has an interpretation as the Tannaka Galois group of a tannakian category
constructed starting from the universal torsor.

1. Introduction

1.1. Aim and scope. Let S be a Dedekind scheme of dimension one and η =
Spec(K) its generic point; let X be a scheme, f : X → S a faithfully ﬂat mor-
phism of ﬁnite type and fη : Xη → η its generic ﬁber. Assume we are given a
ﬁnite K-group scheme G and a G-torsor Y → Xη. So far the problem of extending
the G-torsor Y → Xη has consisted in ﬁnding a ﬁnite and ﬂat S-group scheme
G′ whose generic ﬁbre is isomorphic to G and a G′-torsor T → X whose generic
ﬁbre is isomorphic to Y → Xη as a G-torsor. Some solutions to this problem, from
Grothendieck’s ﬁrst ideas until nowadays, are known in some particular relevant
cases that we brieﬂy recall: Grothendieck proved that, possibly after extending
scalars, the problem has a solution when G is a constant ﬁnite group, S is the spec-
trum of a complete discrete valuation ring with algebraically closed residue ﬁeld
of positive characteristic p, with X proper and smooth over S with geometrically
connected ﬁbers and p ∤ |G| ([10], Expos´e X); when S is the spectrum of a discrete
valuation ring of residue characteristic p, X is a proper and smooth curve over S
then Raynaud suggested a solution, possibly after extending scalars, for |G| = p
([19], §3); when S is the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring R of mixed char-
acteristic (0, p) Tossici provided a solution, possibly after extending scalars, for G
commutative when X is a regular scheme, faithfully ﬂat over S, with some extra as-
sumptions on X and Y ([21], Corollary 4.2.8). Finally in [4], §3.2 and §3.3 the ﬁrst
author provided a solution for G commutative, when S is a connected Dedekind
scheme and f : X → S is a smooth morphism satisfying additional assumptions
(in this last case it is not needed to extend scalars) and in [3] the case where G is
solvable is treated. However a general solution does not exist. Moreover we know
that it can even happen that G does not admit a ﬁnite and ﬂat model (see [15],
Appendix B, Proposition B.2 for the positive equal characteristic case or [20], §3.4
for the mixed characteristic case). What is always true is that G admits at least
an aﬃne, quasi-ﬁnite (then of ﬁnite type, according to our conventions, see §1.2),
ﬂat R-group scheme model. Indeed G is isomorphic to a closed subgroup scheme
of some GLn,K ([22], §3.4) then it is suﬃcient to consider its schematic closure in
GLn,S. In this paper we explain how to solve the problem of extending any G-torsor
when G is any algebraic group scheme over K up to a modiﬁcation of X. When
X is a relative curve this modiﬁcation is represented by a ﬁnite number of N´eron
blow-ups of X in a closed subscheme of the special ﬁber of X. For more precise
statements we refer the reader to §3. The most interesting case is certainly the case
where G is ﬁnite. If we were able to prove that every ﬁnite and pointed torsor over
Xη admits a model over X then the natural morphism ϕ : π(Xη, xη) → πqf (X, x)η
(which is always faithfully ﬂat, [5, §7]) between the fundamental group scheme of
Xη to the generic ﬁber of the quasi-ﬁnite fundamental group scheme of X would be
an isomorphism. It is known that ϕ becomes an isomorphism when we restrict to
the abelianized fundamental group scheme (cf. [4]). Here we ﬁnd a partial answer,
extending all ﬁnite torsors, but instead of providing a model over X we provide
a model over some X ′ obtained slightly modifying X, as explained. In order to
approach the question from a diﬀerent point of view it would be of great interest
to have a tannakian description for πqf (X, x), π(X, x) and their universal torsors
bX qf → X and bX → X. In [14] Mehta and Subramanian provided a ﬁrst construc-
tion which works only for schemes deﬁned over some non-noetherian Pr¨ufer rings
In §2 we give a diﬀerent tannakian
whose function ﬁeld is algebraically closed.

description simply choosing the category of vector bundles on X trivialized by the
universal torsor, whose existence is now known. An intrinsic description, indepen-
dent from the existence of the universal torsor, would be strongly appreciated.

1.2. Notations and conventions. Let S be any scheme, X a S-scheme, G a
(faithfully) ﬂat, aﬃne1 S-group scheme and Y a S-scheme endowed with a right
action σ : Y × G → Y . A S-morphism p : Y → X is said to be a G-torsor if it is
faithfully ﬂat, G-invariant and the canonical morphism (σ, prY ) : Y ×G → Y ×X Y is
an isomorphism. Let H be a ﬂat, aﬃne S-group scheme and q : Z → X a H-torsor;
a morphism between two such torsors is a pair (β, α) : (Z, H) → (Y, G) where
α : H → G is a S-morphism of group schemes, and β : Z → Y is a X-morphism of
schemes such that the following diagram commutes

Z × H

β×α

Y × G

H-action

G-action

Z

/ Y

β

(thus Y is isomorphic to the contracted product Z ×H G through α, cf. [7], III, §4,
3.2). In this case we say that Z precedes Y .

When S is irreducible, η will denote its generic point and K its function ﬁeld
k(η). Any S-scheme whose generic ﬁber is isomorphic to some K-scheme Tη will
be called a model of Tη. Any morphism which is generically an isomorphism will
be called a model map.

Throughout the whole paper a morphism of schemes f : Y → X will be said to
be quasi-ﬁnite if it is of ﬁnite type and for every point x ∈ X the ﬁber Yx is a ﬁnite
set. Let S be any scheme and G an aﬃne S-group scheme. Then we say that G
is a ﬁnite (resp. quasi-ﬁnite) S-group scheme if the structural morphism G → S is
ﬁnite (resp. quasi-ﬁnite).

Let R be a commutative ring with unity and G an aﬃne and ﬂat R-group scheme;
we denote by RepR,tf (G) the category of ﬁnitely generated R-linear representations
of G and by Rep0
R,tf (G) the full subcategory of RepR,tf (G) whose objects are free
(as R-modules).

2. A tannakian construction

Throughout this section R will always be a discrete valuation ring, with uni-
formising element π, with ﬁeld of fractions K := F rac(R) and residue ﬁeld k :=
R/πR. The generic and special points of Spec(R) will often be denoted by η and s
respectively.

Lemma 2.1. Let X be a noetherian scheme over R, T = lim
Ti a projective
limit of X-schemes fi : Ti → X aﬃne over X. We assume that for all i ∈ I,
H 0(Ti, OTi ) = R. Then H 0(T, OT ) = R.

←−i∈I

Proof. This follows from [13], III, Poposition 2.9.

in this paper.

Lemma 2.2. Let j : T → Spec(R) be a surjective faithfully ﬂat morphism and
let us assume that the generic ﬁber Tη of T is such that H 0(Tη, OTη ) = K. Then
H 0(T, OT ) = R.

Proof. We ﬁrst observe that either H 0(T, OT ) = R or H 0(T, OT ) = K. Indeed

R ⊂ H 0(T, OT ) ⊂ H 0(T, OT ) ⊗R K ≃ H 0(Tη, OTη ) = K,

the last isomorphism being a consequence of [13, III, Proposition 9.3], and it is not
diﬃcult to check that a R-algebra containing R and contained in K is either R or K.
However if H 0(T, OT ) = K, then the canonical factorisation of f : T → Spec(R)
into T → Spec(OT (T )) → Spec(R) would not be surjective.
(cid:3)

We apply these remarks to the theory of the (quasi-ﬁnite) fundamental group

scheme and its universal torsor that we brieﬂy recall:

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let X → S be a morphism of schemes endowed with a section
x ∈ X(S). We say that X has a fundamental group scheme (resp. a quasi-ﬁnite fun-
damental group scheme) if there exists a S-group scheme π(X, x) (resp. πqf (X, x))
and a pointed π(X, x)-torsor bX (resp. πqf (X, x)-torsor bX qf ) such that for any ﬁ-
nite (resp. quasi-ﬁnite) torsor Y → X over X, pointed over x, there is a unique
morphism of pointed torsors bX → Y (resp. bX qf → Y ).

In [5], §4,§5.1 and §5.2 we proved the following existence theorems:

Theorem 2.4. Let S be a Dedekind scheme, X → S a faithfully ﬂat morphism
locally of ﬁnite type and x ∈ X(S) a section. Let us moreover assume that one of
the following assumptions is satisﬁed:

(1) for every s ∈ S the ﬁber Xs is reduced;
(2) for every z ∈ X\Xη the local ring OX,z is integrally closed.

Then X has a fundamental group scheme.

Theorem 2.5. Let S be a Dedekind scheme, X → S a faithfully ﬂat morphism
locally of ﬁnite type and x ∈ X(S) a section. Let us moreover assume that X is
integral and normal and that for each s ∈ S the ﬁber Xs is normal and integral.
Then X has a quasi-ﬁnite fundamental group scheme.

Notation 2.6. In order to simplify the exposition from now on we will only consider
the case where X satisﬁes the assumptions of Theorem 2.5. However the statements
proved for the universal πqf (X, x)-torsor will also hold for the universal π(X, x)-
torsor and the proofs are exactly the same.

Deﬁnition 2.7. We say that a quasi-ﬁnite G-torsor over X pointed over x is quasi-
Galois if the canonical morphism ρ : π(X, x)qf → G is schematically dominant
(i.e. R[G] → R[π(X, x)qf ] is injective).
It will be furthermore called Galois, if
ρ : π(X, x)qf → G is faithfully ﬂat.

Lemma 2.8. Let us assume that H 0(X, OX ) = R. Let G be a quasi-ﬁnite and
ﬂat group scheme and T → X a quasi-Galois G-torsor pointed over x. Then
H 0(T, OT ) = R.

Proof. It is suﬃcient to notice that the generic ﬁber Tη of T is Galois over Xη
[16, Chapter 2, Proposition 3]). The
(cf.
conclusion follows by Lemma 2.2.
(cid:3)

[5, §7]), hence H 0(Tη, OTη ) = K (cf.

MODELS OF TORSORS AND THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP SCHEME

Corollary 2.9. Let us assume that H 0(X, OX ) = R. Then H 0( bX qf , O bX qf ) = R.
Proof. First we observe that for any quasi-ﬁnite and ﬂat R-group scheme G, any
G-torsor over X pointed over x is preceded by a quasi-Galois torsor: it is suﬃcient
to factor the canonical morphism πqf (X, x) → G as πqf (X, x) → G′ → G where
πqf (X, x) → G′ is a schematically dominant morphism and G′ → G is a closed
immersion. Then the contracted product bX qf ×πqf (X,x) G′ gives the desired quasi-
Galois torsor. Hence the universal torsor is isomorphic to a projective limit of quasi-
Galois torsor and the conclusion follows using Lemma 2.8, and Lemma 2.1.
(cid:3)

Theorem 2.10. Assumptions being as in Corollary 2.9, the universal π(X, x)qf -
torsor bX qf → X induces an equivalence of categories Rep0
R,tf (πqf (X, x)) → T qf
where T qf denotes the category of vector bundles on X trivialized by bX qf → X.

Let θ : X → Spec(R) denote the structural morphism and let j : T → X be any
G-torsor for some aﬃne and ﬂat R-group scheme G, then we denote by G − V ectT
the category of G-sheaves over T whose objects are locally free as OT -modules; it
is known that the functor j∗ : V ectX → G − V ectT is an equivalence of categories
and we denote by ρ : G − V ectT → V ectX a quasi-inverse. As usual, we naturally
associate to j : T → X the functor FT : Rep0
R,tf G → T , where T denotes the
category of vector bundles on X trivialized by T → X, given by ρ ◦ (j∗ ◦ θ∗).
Thus Theorem 2.10 is a consequence of the following more general statement which
somehow generalizes an analog result for torsors over ﬁelds (cf.
[16, Chapter II,
Proposition 3]):

Lemma 2.11. Let G → Spec(R) be a ﬂat aﬃne group scheme and j : T → X
a G-torsor such that H 0(T, OT ) = R. The functor FT : Rep0
R,tf G → T is an
equivalence of categories.

1 ⊗RV2)G. Analogously if F1, F2 are two objects of G−V ectT , then HomG−V ecT (F1, F2) =

R,tf G. Then Hom(Rep0

Proof. First we observe that the functor FT is fully faithful if and only if (j∗ ◦ θ∗) is
faithfully ﬂat: let V1, V2 be two objects of Rep0
R,tf G)(V1, V2) =
(V ∨
H 0(T, F ∨
Rep0

1 ⊗OT F2)G. Thus FT is fully faithful if and only if, for any object W of

R,tf G, the natural map

(†)

W G → H 0(T, j∗θ∗(W ))G

is an isomorphism. We have the following sequence of isomorphisms (by means of
the projection formula):

H 0(T, j∗θ∗(W )) ≃ H 0(Spec(R), (θ◦j)∗(θ◦j)∗(W )) ≃ H 0(Spec(R), (θ◦j)∗OT ⊗RW ) ≃

≃ H 0(Spec(R), (θ ◦ j)∗OT ) ⊗R W ≃ H 0(T, OT ) ⊗R W

as representations of G, then (H 0(T, j∗θ∗(W )))G ≃ (H 0(T, OT ) ⊗R W )G = W G
since we assumed H 0(T, OT ) = R, whence the desired isomorphism (†). In order
to prove the essential surjectivity, we argue as follows: let us take a vector bundle
E on X trivialized by j : T → X. That implies the existence of a ﬁnitely generated
free R-module M such that E := j∗E ≃ (θ ◦ j)∗M . Again applying the projection
formula we obtain

(θ ◦ j)∗(θ ◦ j)∗M = (θ ◦ j)∗OT ⊗R M = M.

6

MARCO ANTEI AND MICHEL EMSALEM

It follows that E ≃ (θ ◦ j)∗(θ ◦ j)∗(θ ◦ j)∗M ≃ (θ ◦ j)∗(θ ◦ j)∗E ≃ (θ ◦ j)∗H 0(T, E). We
now observe that the previous isomorphism (θ ◦ j)∗(θ ◦ j)∗E → E is G-equivariant
and thus FT (H 0(T, E)) ≃ E.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.12. Lemma 2.11 can be generalized further as follows:
let R be any
commutative and unitary ring, q : T → Spec(R) a morphism of scheme such that
H 0(T, OT ) = R. Let moreover G be any ﬂat and aﬃne R-group scheme, acting on
T and let F be any G-sheaf, trivial as a OT -module. Then H 0(T, F ) is a R-linear
representation of G and F ≃ H 0(T, F ) ⊗R OT as G-sheaves.

Remark 2.13. Notations being as in Lemma 2.11, the tannakian category C over
R (cf.
[11] for a modern and detailed overview) associated to T is the category
of those OX -modules whose pullback over T is isomorphic, as OT -module, to a
ﬁnite direct sum of OT and OT /πn, where π denotes a uniformizer of R and n
a natural integer; in this way T would coincide with the full subcategory C0 of
C of rigid objects of C, i.e. objects isomorphic to their double dual. It would be
very interesting and useful to have an inner description of the objects of T (or
equivalently of C) independent from the universal torsor.

3. Existence of a model

3.1. Quotients and N´eron blow-ups. In this section we are going to recall some
results ensuring the existence of quotients of schemes under the action of some group
schemes, under certain assumptions. Those results are essentially contained in [10],
Expos´e V, Th´eor`eme 7.1 and [18], Th´eor`eme 1, (iv), for the ﬁnite case and [18],
Th´eor`eme 1, (v) and [2], Th´eor`eme 7, Appendice 1, for the quasi-ﬁni case. The fact
that quotients (under the action of ﬁnite type group schemes) commute with base
change is ensured by [10, Expos´e IV, 3.4.3.1].

Theorem 3.1. Let T be a locally noetherian scheme, Z a T -scheme locally of ﬁnite
type, H a ﬂat T -group scheme acting on Z in such a way that Z ×T H → Z ×T Z
is a closed immersion. Then if one of the following conditions is veriﬁed

(1) H → T is ﬁnite and Z → T is quasi-projective,
(2) H → T is quasi-ﬁnite and Z → T is quasi-ﬁnite,

the sheaf (Z/H)f pqc is represented by a scheme Z/H. Moreover the canonical
morphism Z → Z/H is faithfully ﬂat and the natural morphism Z×T H → Z×Z/H Z
is an isomorphism.

Theorem 3.2. Let T be any locally noetherian scheme, Z a T -scheme locally of
ﬁnite type, H a ﬂat T -group scheme acting on Z such that the natural morphism
Z ×T H → Z ×T Z is a closed immersion. Then there exists a largest open U of
Z for which the sheaf (U/H)f pqc is represented by a scheme U/H. Moreover U
is dense in Z and contains the points of Z of codimension ≤ 1. Furthermore the
canonical morphisms U → U/H is faithfully ﬂat.

Proof. It has been ﬁrst stated in [18], Th´eor`eme 1, i) and a proof is contained in
[2], Proposition 3.3.1. The last assertion is just [18], §4, Proposition 2.
(cid:3)

The conclusion is that, in both cases, Z → Z/H and U → U/H are H-torsors.

Corollary 3.3. Let S be a Dedekind scheme with function ﬁeld K and X → S a
faithfully ﬂat morphism of ﬁnite type. Let moreover G′ be an aﬃne and ﬂat S-group
scheme, Z a faithfully ﬂat S-scheme provided with a right G′-action σ : Z×SG′ → Z

MODELS OF TORSORS AND THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUP SCHEME

and g : Z → X a G′-invariant (i.e. g ◦ σ = g ◦ prZ) S-morphism such that the
natural morphism Z ×S G′ → Z ×X Z is a closed immersion inducing a G′
η-torsor
structure on Zη over Xη. Let U be the largest open of Z as in Theorem 3.2 such
that U/G′ is a scheme; then X ′ := U/G′ is faithfully ﬂat and of ﬁnite type over S
and the natural morphism λ : X ′ → X is a model map. In particular U → X ′ is a
G′-torsor extending the G′

η-torsor Zη → Xη.

Proof. By Theorem 3.2, U contains the points of Z of codimension2 ≤ 1 so in
particular it contains, for all closed points s ∈ S, the generic points of the irreducible
components of Zs. As U is the largest open of Z such that U/G′ is a scheme, so in
particular it contains Zη. Thus U is surjective over S. Hence X ′ is surjective over S
too and it is S-ﬂat and of ﬁnite type because U has the same properties (inherited
by Z). Thus X ′ → X gives rise to the desired model map. The last assertion is
clear.
(cid:3)

We now recall the deﬁnition of N´eron blow-up. Unless stated otherwise, from

now till the end of section §3.1 we only consider the following situation:

Notation 3.4. We denote by S the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring R with
uniformising element π and with fraction and residue ﬁeld respectively denoted
by K and k. As usual η and s will denote the generic and special point of S
respectively. Finally we denote by X a faithfully ﬂat S-scheme of ﬁnite type.

According to [6], §3.2 Proposition 1 or [2], II, 2.1.2 (A), the following statement

holds :

Proposition 3.5. Let S be the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring R with uni-
formising element π. Let X be a faithfully ﬂat S-scheme of ﬁnite type and let C be
a closed subscheme of the special ﬁber Xs of X and let I be the sheaf of ideals of
OX deﬁning C. Let X ′ → X be the blow up of X at C and u : X C → X denote its
restriction to the open subscheme of X ′ where I · OX is generated by π. Then:

(1) X C is a ﬂat S-scheme, u is an aﬃne model map.
(2) For any ﬂat S-scheme Z and for any S-morphism v : Z → X such that
vk factors through C, there exists a unique S-morphism v′ : Z → X C such
that v = u ◦ v′.

Deﬁnition 3.6. The morphism X C → X (or simply X C ) as in Proposition 3.5
is called the N´eron blow up of X at C and property 2 is often referred to as the
universal property of the N´eron blow up.

3.2. Construction of a model. Given an algebraic G-torsor Y → Xη we do not
know whether or not we can ﬁnd a torsor over X, whose generic ﬁber is isomorphic
to the given one. In §1.1 we have recalled the most important and recent results
that partially solve this problem when G is ﬁnite; here we suggest a new approach
in a much wider context, including the case G of ﬁnite type.

Theorem 3.7. Let S be the spectrum of a discrete valuation ring R with function
ﬁeld K. Let X → S be a faithfully ﬂat morphism of ﬁnite type with X a regular
and integral scheme of absolute dimension 2 endowed with a section x ∈ X(S). Let
G be a ﬁnite K-group and f : Y → Xη a G-torsor pointed in y ∈ Yxη (K), then
there exists an integral scheme X ′ faithfully ﬂat and of ﬁnite type over S, a model

map λ : X ′ → X and a G0-torsor f ′ : Y0 → X ′ extending the given G-torsor Y for
some quasi-ﬁnite and ﬂat S-group scheme G0. Moreover X ′ can be obtained by X
after a ﬁnite number of N´eron blow-ups.

Theorem 3.8. Let S be the spectrum of a Henselian discrete valuation ring R with
function ﬁeld K and with algebraically closed residue ﬁeld. Let X → S be a smooth
and surjective morphism with X a connected scheme. Let G be an aﬃne K-group
scheme of ﬁnite type and f : Y → Xη a G-torsor, then there exists, possibly after
extension of scalars, a connected scheme X ′ smooth and surjective over S, a model
map λ : X ′ → X and a G0-torsor f ′ : Y0 → X ′ extending the given G-torsor Y for
some aﬃne ﬁnite type and ﬂat S-group scheme G0. If moreover G is ﬁnite then
G0 is quasi-ﬁnite and there exists an open sub-scheme W ⊆ X such that X\W
has codimension ≥ 3 in X and such that X ′ can be obtained from W after a ﬁnite
number of N´eron blow-ups.

Before proceeding with the proofs of Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 we need some pre-

liminary results:

Lemma 3.9. Let S be a Dedekind scheme with function ﬁeld K and X → S a
faithfully ﬂat morphism of ﬁnite type with X regular and integral. For any vector
bundle V on Xη there exist a open subscheme X1 ⊆ X containing Xη, where X\X1
has codimension ≥ 3 in X, such that X1 is faithfully ﬂat and of ﬁnite type over S
and a vector bundle W on X1 such that W|Xη ≃ V . If moreover dim(X) = 2 then
we can choose X1 = X.

Proof. Let us denote by j : Xη → X the natural open immersion. First of all
we observe that there exists a coherent sheaf F on X such that j∗(F ) ≃ V (cf.
for instance [13], II, ex. 5.15). Then F ∨∨, i.e. the double dual of F , is a coherent
reﬂexive sheaf. That j∗(F ∨∨) ≃ V follows from the well known fact that j∗(F ∨∨) ≃
j∗(F )∨∨ ≃ V (see for instance the proof of [12], Proposition 1.8). If dim(X) = 2
then by [12], Corollary 1.4 we set W := F ∨∨ which is a vector bundle and this is the
last assertion. As for the higher dimension case we know, again by [12], Corollary
1.4, that the subset C of points where F ∨∨ is not locally free is a closed subset of
codimension ≥ 3. We call X1 the complementary open subset of C in X to which
we give the induced scheme structure and we thus know that X1 contains Xη and
has nonempty intersection with Xs for any closed point s ∈ S, whence the ﬁrst
assertion.
(cid:3)

Let T be any scheme;

following [9] (11.6) we associate to any locally free
sheaf V of rank n over T the sheaf IsomOT (O⊕n
T , V ) which is a GLn,T -torsor
IsomOT (O⊕n
T , V ) → T , thus obtaining a bijective map between isomorphism classes
of locally free sheaves of rank n over T and isomorphism classes of GLn,T -torsors
over T . It is an exercise to prove that this construction base changes correctly (i.e. if
i : T ′ → T is a morphism of schemes then i∗(IsomOT (O⊕n
as GLn,T ′-torsors).

T , V )) ≃ IsomOT ′ (O⊕n

T ′ , i∗(V ))

Proof. of Theorem 3.7. We do the following construction: we take any closed
immersion ρ : G ֒→ GLn,K for a suitable n (by [22], §3.4). The contracted product
Z := Y ×G GLn,K via ρ is a GLn,K-torsor, then Z ≃ IsomOXη (On
, V ) for a
Xη
suitable vector bundle V on Xη (for instance one can choose V := f∗(OY )) of rank
n. Let W be a vector bundle on X, as in Lemma 3.9, whose restriction to Xη is

isomorphic to V ; let Z ′ := IsomOX (On
X , W ) be the corresponding GLn,S-torsor
extending Z. Let us denote by Y and G the schematic closures of Y in Z ′ and G
in GLn,S respectively. We thus obtain the following diagrams

In general neither Y → X nor Y → S will be faithfully ﬂat, however we can
modify the embedding G ֒→ GLn,K in order to obtain at least the surjectivity of
Y → S (which will be thus faithfully ﬂat). As we will see this will be suﬃcient to
conclude. Let us now pull back the GLn,S-torsor Z ′ → X over x : Spec(R) → X:
we obtain a trivial torsor, whence the existence of a section z′ ∈ Z ′
x(S) whose
generic ﬁber is z′
η ∈ Zxη (K). Let us now call z ∈ Zxη (K) the image of y through
the closed embedding i : Y ֒→ Z constructed in diagram (1). In general, unless
we are extremely lucky, it will not coincide with zη, but, as they both live over xη,
there exists g ∈ GLn,K(K) such that zη = z · g. Let us consider the isomorphism
of Xη-schemes ϕg : Z → Z, z0 7→ z0 · g. The composition λ := ϕg ◦ i : Y ֒→ Z is
a closed immersion sending y to zη and it turns out to be a morphism of torsors
i.e. commuting with the actions of G and GLn,K if we consider the new embedding
′
σ : G ֒→ GLn,K deﬁned as σ : g0 7→ g−1ρ(g0)g. If we now consider Y
and G
respectively the closure of λ : Y ֒→ Z in Z ′ and the closure of σ : G → GLn,K in
GLn,R, then we observe that the natural morphism u : Y
is a
closed immersion: it follows from the commutative diagram

Proof. of the Theorem 3.8 We repeat the ﬁrst part of the proof of Theorem 3.7 in
order to obtain a morphism of torsors i : Y ֒→ Z, which is a closed immersion,
from the given G torsor to a GLn,K-torsor Z := IsomOXη (On

bundle V over Xη. Now let X1 be as in Lemma 3.9 and W a vector bundle on X1

As R is Henselian with algebraically closed residue ﬁeld and as X1 → S is
smooth and surjective there exists a section x1 ∈ X1(S). If necessary after a ﬁnite
extension of scalars K ֒→ K ′, YK ′ is pointed over x1,η; we can thus translate the
problem to R′, the Henselian ring obtained as the integral closure of R in K ′. In
order to ease notations we assume R = R′ from now on and we ﬁx a point y ∈ Yx1,η .
Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 3.7 we can (and we actually do) assume that
i(y) = z1,η ∈ Zx1,η (K) where z1 ∈ Z1x1(R) is a R-section of Z1 → S, which always
exists as we have seen before, hence Y → S is faithfully ﬂat. As in the proof of
¯Y is a closed immersion. Using Corollary 3.3 there
Theorem 3.7, ¯Y ×S ¯G → ¯Y ×X1
exists a largest open U of Z, faithfully ﬂat over S, such that U → U/G is a G-torsor
extending the given one. If we set X ′ := U/G, G0 := G and Y0 := U then we obtain
the desired result. If G is ﬁnite the fact that U = Y (we apply to the previous
construction Theorem 3.1 instead of Corollary 3.3) implies the last assertion. (cid:3)
