Abstract

Bearing–only estimation is one of the fundamental and challenging problems in target tracking. As in the case of radar tracking,
the presence of offset or position biases can exacerbate the challenges in bearing–only estimation. Modeling various sensor biases
is not a trivial task and not much has been done in the literature speciﬁcally for bearing–only tracking. This paper addresses the
modeling of offset biases in bearing–only sensors and the ensuing multitarget tracking with bias compensation. Bias estimation
is handled at the fusion node to which individual sensors report their local tracks in the form of associated measurement reports
(AMR) or angle-only tracks. The modeling is based on a multisensor approach that can effectively handle a time–varying number
of targets in the surveillance region. The proposed algorithm leads to a maximum likelihood bias estimator. The corresponding
Cram´er–Rao Lower Bound to quantify the theoretical accuracy that can be achieved by the proposed method or any other algorithm
is also derived. Finally, simulation results on different distributed tracking scenarios are presented to demonstrate the capabilities
of the proposed approach. In order to show that the proposed method can work even with false alarms and missed detections,
simulation results on a centralized tracking scenario where the local sensors send all their measurements (not AMRs or local
tracks) are also presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

Multisensor–multitarget bearing–only tracking is a challenging problem with many applications [4], [5], [13], [27]. Some
applications of bearing–only tracking are in maritime surveillance using sonobuoys, underwater target tracking using sonar
and passive ground target tracking using Electronic Support Measures (ESM) or Infra–red Search and Track (IRST) sensors.
In such applications, it is of interest to ﬁnd the target position as well as any biases that may affect estimation performance.
From the early works in [1], [2], [36] to the more recent works in [29] and the references therein, the focus has been only
on tracking the targets based on measurements from a bearing–only sensor. However, due to the limitations of single sensor
bearing–only tracking, i.e., due to the need for own–ship maneuvers for the observability of state parameters [28], the issue of
biases in passive single sensor tracking has not been addressed in the literature. The main focus of this paper is multisensor
bearing–only tracking in the presence of biases. In multisensor bearing-only tracking, observability is no longer a major issue.
However, in the case of port–starboard ambiguity, the problem of observability was discussed in detail in [10]. Besides, the
presence of sensor biases that are often unaccounted for can degrade the estimation results signiﬁcantly. Most of the works on
bias estimation have been about radar tracking (see [20], [42], [43] and the references therein) or using other measurements
besides bearing information [6], [7]. For example, when the elevation information is available, one can estimate the offset
biases as in [7], [14].

With the objective of providing a combined bias estimation and target tracking algorithm that is both theoretically sound
and practical, the problem of multisensor bearing-only multitarget tracking is considered in this paper. Having more than one
passive sensor in the surveillance region ensures the observability of the state parameters, i.e., position and velocity of the
target, without the need for maneuvers [33], [35], [44]. One of the issues that can complicate bearing–only tracking is the bias
in the sensors. For example, in maritime surveillance using sonobuoys, which are usually dropped from an aircraft or thrown
from a ship close to an area of interest, the exact locations of the sonobuoys are not known. This leads to position biases [25].
This is also an isuue in modern systems such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) [9]. In addition, the impact with the
water surface and the waves can result in systemic offset biases [6]. In wide area surveillance using airborne IRST sensors,
uncertain platform motion can contribute to biases as well. Offset bias can be modeled as an additive constant term affecting
the measurement equation and the sensor position uncertainty can be modeled using a random walk [31].

Negligible biases can be treated as residual errors. This residual error can be used in the form of additional uncertainty
in the measurements later in the ﬁltering step. However, if offset biases are larger than the noise standard deviation of the
bearing–only measurements, a mirror of the target’s bearing is sent to fusion center instead of its actual value, which will
result in totally erroneous estimates. Further, these erroneous measurements can worsen state estimation results when fused
with measurements from similarly biased sensors. In order to beneﬁt from the information available from multiple bearing–only
sensors with offset bias, one needs to model, estimate and then correct the biases. This is precisely the motivation for this
paper.

The focus of this paper is offset bias estimation. In order to model offset biases, one can transform the measurement
space of sensor data to Cartesian coordinates followed by covariance matrix transformation. This transformation will make it
possible to ﬁnd an exact model for the biases that can be used in bias estimation and correction. However, the full position
information is not available in a single bearing–only measurement. The process of measurement transformation is done by
paring measurements from different sensors in the surveillance region. That is, this transformation is done through triangulation
[21]. With the new pseudo–measurement in Cartesian coordinates, position and velocity of the targets can be estimated over
time as new measurements are generated from paired sensors at subsequent times [3], [19], [24], [35]. Assuming that these
state estimates also carry the effects of offset biases, it is possible to ﬁnd such biases, if any, and correct them. In the case
of bistatic passive sensors, one can use the methods in [37], [44]. However, previous work on multisensor bearing–only bias
estimation is still limited. The method presented here gives a comprehensive analysis of offset bias modeling in multisensor
passive bearing–only sensors.

The proposed method gives an exact model for bearing–only biases in Cartesian coordinates. In addition, the formulation
of an appropriate likelihood function enables the use of maximum likelihood estimators to ﬁnd the biases. Also, the proposed
model is robust against large sensor noise standard deviation. Finally, as shown through simulation results, large bearing biases
can be estimated accurately, which leads to correspondingly accurate target state estimation results.

The goal of this paper is to present a step–by–step approach for designing a multisensor–multitarget tracking system based
on biased bearing–only measurements and give a practical solution to the problem of bias estimation. In Section II, a detailed
model of the multisensor bearing–only estimation problem with bias is given. Section III is devoted to modeling the offset biases
in Cartesian coordinates. In Section IV, a practical solution for bias estimation is proposed. Section V presents the derivation of
Cram´er–Rao lower bounds. Simulation results are shown in Section VI along with discussions on different scenarios. Finally,
Section VII ends the paper with conclusions.

II. BEARING–ONLY ESTIMATION PROBLEM

Bearing–only sensors with operating ranges of hundreds of meters to a few kilometers are one of the most crucial sensors in
maritime or ground surveillance applications. These sensors can actively or passively detect the directions of arrival of signals
emitted by the targets of interest. While underwater surveillance is the common application of bearing–only tracking, it is also
used in surface and air target tracking. For example, ESM and IRST sensors also use bearing–only sensors for tracking. As
shown in Figure 1, bearing–only sensors can be on the own–ship or deployed separately in the surveillance region. Moreover,
they can operate under different environmental conditions as shown in Figure 1 [8], [26].

Fig. 1: Bearing–only sensors and signal propagation types [26]

The bearing–only measurement from passive sensors is written as

zs(k) = θs(k) + bs + ws(k),

(1)

𝜌1𝜌2spherical spreading losscylindrical spreadingSonar sensorAccepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronics Systems, March 2016

where zs(k) is the direction of arrival at sensor s, θs is the true bearing of the target, bs is the constant bias in the measurements
of sensor s and ws is an additive zero–mean white Gaussian noise with variance σ2
θ. It is assumed that there are S bearing–only
sensors in the surveillance region at positions (xs, ys) for s = 1, 2, ..., S, and, they record targets’ bearings at time instants
k = 1, ..., K. Note that there is no index to denote target ID, but wherever such clariﬁcation is needed, it will be included.

In this paper, bias estimation is handled at the fusion node to which individual sensors report their local tracks in the form
of associated measurement reports (AMR) [16], [46] or angle-only tracks. That is, a distributed tracking system is considered
as in the case of [31], [32], [42]. However, the difference is that in these earlier works local full-state tracks were sent to the
fusion node for bias estimation whereas AMRs or bearing-only tracks are sent in the present case where the local sensors do
not have full observability due to bearing-only measurements. As in [31], [32], [42], working with tracks or AMRs obviates
the need at the fusion center to address false alarms and missed detections that are inevitable at the local sensors although
ghost tracks may be present among local tracks. However, in order to show that the proposed method can work even with false
alarms and missed detections in a centralized tracking system, in one experiment in Section VI we assume that the local sensors
send all their measurements (including false alarms and missed detections instead of AMRs or local bearing-only tracks) and
evaluate the performance of the proposed method. In [37] and [44], where bias estimation at measurement level (rather than at
track level as in [31], [32], [42]) is considered, false alarms and missed detections are not addressed at all. In [30], a joint data
association and bias estimation method was proposed for linear measurement models, which is not applicable for bearing-only
systems. A general case of multistatic passive radar system with false alarms and missed detections was considered in [17]
and [15], but, the bias problem was not addressed.

The goal of bearing–only tracking is to ﬁnd the bias in each sensor and estimate each target’s position as accurately as
possible based on the model given in (1), either as decoupled parameters or jointly [11], [45]. Due to the computational burdens
of joint tracking and parameter estimation methods [22], a decoupled bias and state estimation is presented in this paper.

It is assumed that each target is following the Discretized Continuous White Noise Acceleration (DCWNA) or the nearly

constant velocity (NCV) model [5]. As a result, a target’s state vector in 2D Cartesian coordinate is given by

x (k) = (cid:2) x(k)

vx(k)

y(k)

with (x(k), y(k)) being the position and (vx(k), vy(k)) being the velocity. The motion model can further be deﬁned as

x (k + 1) = F (k)x (k) + ν(k)

In order to transform the measurements from polar to Cartesian coordinates, it is initially assumed that S is even and that
the sensors are paired into S
2 one–to–one pairs. Note that this constraint is relaxed in Section IV. For a pair of sensors with a
single target in the common ﬁeld of view, the best estimate for the location of the target, independent of its previous location,
can be obtained through triangulation [14], [21], [38]. The triangulated estimates of the target position at time k using sensor
pair (i, j), ignoring measurement noise, are given by

ˆxij(k) =

yj − yi + xi tan (θi(k) + bi)

tan (θi(k) + bi) − tan (θj(k) + bj)

If no bias estimation is needed, these pseudo–measurements in Cartesian coordinates can be used in a Kalman ﬁlter with their
associated covariance matrices to recursively estimate the target’s position [12].

III. BIAS MODELING IN CARTESIAN COORDINATES

As discussed in Section II, bearing–only biases are in the form of the additive constants. Although additive constant biases
have already been dealt with in the case of radar measurements [42] and [43], it is not possible to generate similar pseudo–
measurements with bearing–only data directly. One way to formulate pseudo–measurements with biases is to model in Cartesian
coordinates. In this section, a step–by–step procedure to model the biases and to separate them from original track positions
in Cartesian coordinates is given. In Section IV, the pseudo–measurement generation is discussed in detail.

In Section II, the process of mapping from bearing–only measurements to Cartesian was given. In order to model the biases,
one can start with separating the bias terms in (8) and (9) from the original track position in Cartesian coordinates. This
separation of bias terms provides the necessary information to create a pseudo–measurement that properly addresses the biases
as in the case of radar measurements. Once the pseudo–measurements are generated, it is possible to estimate the biases and
remove them. The process of ﬁnding the bias terms that contribute to (8) and (9) starts with expanding the tan (·) function as

tan (α + β) =

tan (α) + tan (β)
1 − tan (α) tan (β)

(15)

Applying (15) to (8) and (9), and separating the terms related to the bias from those related to the target position will give a
new set of equations to deﬁne the position of the target in Cartesian coordinates. To make the parameter separation easier to
follow, the common terms are deﬁned and named ﬁrst. For the common terms in ˆxij(k) and ˆyij(k), one can deﬁne

B = 1 + tan (θi(k)) tan (θj(k))

Further, deﬁne the following for the terms in ˆxij(k):

x = − (yj − yi) tan (θi(k)) + xj tan (θi(k)) tan (θj(k)) + xi

Similarly, for the terms in ˆyij(k), deﬁne

Dy = yj tan (θi(k)) − yi tan (θj(k)) + (xj − xi) tan (θi(k)) tan (θj(k))
y = (xj − xi) tan (θj(k)) + yi tan (θi(k)) tan (θj(k)) + yj
Bi
y = (xj − xi) tan (θi(k)) − yj tan (θi(k)) tan (θj(k)) − yi
Bj
y = yi tan (θi(k)) − yj tan (θj(k)) + (xj − xi)

With these factorizations, bias terms can be separated from the target state values in Cartesian coordinates. It can be seen that

the vector(cid:2) ˆxij(k)

ˆyij(k) (cid:3)T can be written as1

Note that in the above formulations it is assumed that the biases and the true bearings are available. In practice, only the noisy
or estimated values are available. Assuming small values for the bias and noise terms, one can use the above formulation
without signiﬁcant loss in accuracy. Similar assumptions has been made in the previous works on bias estimation [31], [32],
[42]. A technical discussion on the range of bias and noise values for which the above formulation is valid is given in Section
VI.

IV. BEARING–ONLY TRACKING AND REGISTRATION

Bearing–only sensor registration is a challenging problem in target tracking that has been addressed in [34], [37], [41].
In order to ﬁnd the biases and correct the measurements, one should ﬁrst look into the observability of the bias variables.
Note that in (26), provided that the target is not on the line that connects the two sensors used in the triangulation or in the
vicinity of one of the sensors, the state parameters are observable [4]. In addition, if there are two pairs of sensors tracking
the same target, the biases become observable as it is shown in IV-A. To estimate the biases decoupled from the state vector, a
pseudo–measurement that can address the bias vector directly must be deﬁned. In this section, a new formulation is proposed
to create a pseudo–measurement that can be used for bias estimation with bearing–only data. The key requirement of this
method in order to ensure observability of all parameters is to have at least two sensor pairs in the surveillance region. In the
following, two practical scenarios that can be expanded to a more general formulation to handle varying number of sensors
and targets are discussed in detail.

A. Pseudo–measurement of bearing–only measurements

To handle practical bearing–only scenarios, two different cases are analyzed here. In each case, a separate pseudo–measurement
model is proposed along with its associated covariance matrix. The main idea is to use two different position approximations
to create a pseudo–measurement as discussed below.

1) Four–sensor (or any even number of sensors) case: Assuming that there are two pairs of sensors in the surveillance
region, a vector of nonlinear pseudo–measurements can be deﬁned by subtracting the target positions based on the pairs (i, j)
and (m, n) as

zb(k) =

+ w(k)

(31)

where w(k) is the additive zero–mean white Gaussian noise associated with the pseudo–measurement and its covariance matrix
is deﬁned as

Rw(k) = Rxy

ij (k) + Rxy

ij (k)

(32)

1The superscript “u” indicates that the parameter is unbiased.

(cid:20) ˆxij(k) − ˆxmn(k)

ˆyij(k) − ˆymn(k)

(cid:21)

Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronics Systems, March 2016

Using the fact that in the absence of bias and noise terms, measurements from any two sensors point to the same target location
regardless of the sensor locations, the pseudo–measurement zb(k) can be written as

zb(k) =

+ w(k)

(33)

for two uncorrelated pairs of sensors. This can be applied to any even number of sensors.

2) Three–sensor (or any odd number of sensors) case: In this case, one must create two position approximations from
triangulation to be able to create a pseudo–measurement for biases. Since there are only three sensors, the possible pairs are
(i, j) and (i, m). Then, the pseudo–measurement can be approximated by

(cid:20) βx (bi, bj) − βx (bm, bn)

βy (bi, bj) − βx (bm, bn)

(cid:21)

(cid:20) ˆxij(k) − ˆxim(k)

ˆyij(k) − ˆyim(k)

(cid:21)

zb(k) =

+ w(k)

(34)

where w(k) is approximately additive zero–mean white Gaussian noise associated with the pseudo–measurement and its
covariance matrix is deﬁned as

Rw(k) = Rxy

ij (k) + Rxy

im(k)

(35)

Because of the correlation between the two tracks from three sensors in Cartesian coordinates, the noise is not white anymore
and this formulation is only an approximation.

As in the case for four sensors, the pseudo–measurement zb(k) can be written as

zb(k) =

+ w(k)

(36)

Note that for simplicity, the arguments θi(k), θj(k), θm(k) and θn(k) have been dropped from (33) and (36). With an arbitrary
odd number of sensors, one sensor need to be paired with two other, resulting in in a similar approximation. As for the more
general case of n arbitrary sensors, methods similar to [42] can be adopted to handle the situation.

B. Batch maximum–likelihood estimator

To apply a batch estimator for bias estimation, one needs to form a likelihood function. Following (35) and (33), and
assuming that the noise is white, zero–mean and Gaussian, the likelihood function of the bias parameters given two pairs of
sensors is

(cid:20) βx (bi, bj) − βx (bi, bm)

βy (bi, bj) − βx (bi, bm)

where the nonlinear function h(b) of the bias vector is given by

Assuming independence over time, one can write the likelihood function over k = 1, ..., K as

p (Zb | b) =

p (zb(k) | b)

where

k=1

Zb = {zb(1), zb(2), . . . , zb(K)}

Finally, the vector ˆb that maximizes the likelihood function can be written as

ˆb = arg max

The above assumes that there is only one target, but it can be extended to the multitarget case using the stacked parameter
estimator.

V. CRAM ´ER–RAO LOWER BOUND FOR BEARING ONLY BIAS ESTIMATION

This section is devoted to the calculation of the Cram´er–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) on the estimation accuracy of bias
parameters by using the pseudo–measurements introduced in Subsection IV-A. Note that based on (38), the measurement
equation for target t at time k is

To evaluate how the proposed method performs in practical scenarios, a series of simulations is presented in this section.
The implementation details on bias estimation, ﬁltering and fusion are also discussed. Simulation results on different scenarios
are given with discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed bias estimator.

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS

A. Motion models and measurement generation

A tracking scenario with four bearing–only sensors and sixteen targets is considered as shown in Figure 2. It is assumed
that all sensors are synchronized and that the bias ranges are between −0.05 rad and 0.05 rad. The standard deviation of
measurement noise is σθ = 0.0261 rad = 1.5◦ for target bearing measurements, which is higher than what was previously
assumed in the literature [6]. The true motion of the targets is modeled using the DCWNA or the NCV model [4] with
qx = qy = 0.001m2/s3. In the local trackers, DCWNA and Continuous Wiener Process Acceleration (CWPA) are used with
qx = qy = 0.1m2/s3 to create different scenarios for the simulation. In all scenarios, the sampling time is T = 1s. To validate
the proposed bias model and to quantify its performance at different bias values, the biases are set to both positive and negative
values in different ranges as follows:

btest1 = (cid:2) 0.04 rad −0.02 rad 0.03 rad −0.02 rad (cid:3)T
btest2 = (cid:2) −0.04 rad −0.02 rad −0.03 rad −0.02 rad (cid:3)T
btest3 = (cid:2) 0.04 rad 0.02 rad 0.03 rad 0.02 rad (cid:3)T

B. Bias estimation and the Genetic Algorithm

In this paper, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) [18] is used to solve the optimization problem in (41). The Genetic Algorithm is an
efﬁcient optimization algorithm for highly nonlinear objective functions [40] that is widely used in different applications [18].
Note that although the GA is a batch ML estimator, the length of the window can be varied depending on user criteria to meet
the real–time requirements. The parameters used in the simulations are shown in Table I. The algorithms were implemented
on a computer with Intel R(cid:13) CoreTM i7-3720Qm 2.60GHz processor and 8GB RAM.

C. Bias estimation: Four–sensor distributed problem

In this scenario, all four sensors deﬁned earlier are used to implement the GA. Four out of sixteen targets are used for
performance evaluation. AMRs or local bearing–only tracks are collected over 100 time steps and the GA is applied to the
whole data in batch mode. The GA is run with the settings in Table I and the ﬁnal results are gathered after the termination of
the GA. Then, the estimated bias vector is used over 100 Monte Carlo runs to calculate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
for comparison. As the benchmark, the CRLB is also calculated based on the derivations in Section V. The RMSE values and

(cid:112)CRLB{[b]i} of the ML estimates with the three different sets of bias parameters are shown in Tables II, III and IV.
Although there is a difference between the RMSE and(cid:112)CRLB{[b]i}, the RMSE results are nearly an order of magnitude

smaller than the bias values, which indicates that any correction made based on the estimated biases will result in better
position estimates. Note that the CRLB in bearing–only tracking problems can be overly optimistic and may even approach

zero (i.e., perfect estimates) in a network of bearing–only sensors [23]. Thus, the difference between the theoretical CRLB
and the empirical RMSE is not of major concern.

To show how much the proposed bias estimation method can help in correcting the target tracks, another simulation is
conducted. In this simulation, it is assumed that the tracker has access to the ﬁnal estimated bias vector (output of the GA)
and then a Kalman ﬁlter is run with the bias estimates in hand. To use the estimated bias parameters, one should, ﬁrst, correct
the bearing–only measurements with the estimated values. The correction must be done both in the measurement vector and
its associated covariance matrix. Since the estimated biases do not have the covariance information, a scaled version of the the
calculated CRLB of the bias parameters is used instead. The scaling factor can be determined through experiments. Then, the
tracker can be run with these corrected measurements to ﬁnd the position and velocity estimates of all targets in the surveillance
region. The position RMSE of the original tracks before correction, the RMSE of the corrected estimates and the Cram´er–Rao
lower bounds are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

Fig. 3: Position RMSE with distributed tracking for corrected and original tracks of target 2 (set 1)

As shown in Figures 3 and 4, for case 1, Figures 5 and 6 for case 2 and Figures 7 and 8 for case 3, the position error
is reduced signiﬁcantly in terms of the position RMSE. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the bias model proposed and
the ML estimation algorithm, i.e., the GA, that is applied to the data. Although, according to the results, the correction factor
varies based on the sensor–target orientation, the corrected track and its associated covariance do follow the bias–free values
accurately, which demonstrates the capability of the proposed algorithm in estimating the biases. To process a batch of data
with K = 100, the computational time is 44.1s in MATLAB.

D. Bias estimation: Three–sensor distributed problem

To show the accuracy of bias estimation when there are only three sensors in the surveillance region, the same Genetic
Algorithm is used to solve the ML problem in (41). The primary issue with three sensors is that one of them, here sensor
i, is used to pair with both sensors j and m. This leads to correlation between the two tracks over time. Assuming that the
correlation is negligible, the same method is applied to estimate the biases. Further, for the case of three sensors, the bias
values are set to

btest = (cid:2) 0.04 rad 0.02 rad 0.03 rad (cid:3)T

Fig. 5: Position RMSE with distributed tracking for corrected and original tracks of target 2 (set 2)

to be able to distinguish between the original and corrected tracks. The constraints on the lower and upper bounds of the
optimization algorithm are set to −0.05 rad and 0.05 rad, respectively. The tolerance value for the GA is also set to 1× 10−15.
Figures 9 and 10 show the result for position estimates in Cartesian coordinates.

The corrected tracks are sill better in terms of RMSE, which means that the estimated biases are accurate enough in spite

of the correlation.

E. Real–time window–based Genetic Algorithm

It is important for the proposed method to be able to work in real–time. For this purpose, the GA can be set to run, in each

iteration, for a speciﬁc window size or duration. The settings of the GA for real time scenarios are given in Table V.

The ﬁnal estimates and the population matrix in one window can be used as the initial conditions for the next window.
Thus, the estimates of the biases can be used to correct the measurements at the end of processing each window of data. The
results of the simulations using this approach for the case of four sensors (test 1) are given in Figures 11 and 12.

As shown in Figures 11 and 12, the GA is still able to ﬁnd the biases with a smaller window size and fewer generations.
Note that updating the biases with smaller window sizes enables the use of methods similar to [42], [43] for arbitrary number

of sensors in the surveillance region. With this setting, biases can be updated every 9.25 s in MATLAB. This simple example
shows that even when the processing time is a crucial parameter in the design, one can still handle bias estimation in real–time
using the proposed method.

F. Bias estimation with false measurements: Four–sensor centralized problem

To demonstrate how the proposed method performs in the presence of false alarms and missed associations in a centralized
fusion framework where local sensors send all their measurements instead of AMRs or bearing–only tracks, a simulation is
presented in this section. The probability mass function of the number of false alarms or clutter points in surveillance volume
V as a function of their spatial density λ is deﬁned as

where m is the number of false alarms [5]. With bearing–only measurements, the volume is V = 2π (rad). It is assumed
that the average number of false alarms per unit volume in a scan, i.e., λ, is 0.5. Also, it is assumed that PD = 0.7 for each
sensor. Note that in this centralized case, the local sensors send all measurements (rather than AMRs or local bearing–only

create a pseudo–measurement for bias estimation, false tracks are often removed prior to generating the pseudo–measurement
vector, which then is sent to the bias estimator. Typically, false tracks do not exist for more than a few time steps as they
are dependent on all four sensors creating false alarms at the same time steps, in the same region, and for a reasonably long
interval of time.

problem in (41). The RMSE values and(cid:112)CRLB{[b]i} of the ML estimates with the bias parameters as deﬁned in (53) are

To show the accuracy of bias estimation in a centralized system, the same Genetic Algorithm is used to solve the ML

shown in Table VI. Note that the CRLB values are optimistic because they do not factor in the false alarms or the missed
detections and that the ML estimator does not factor in the false alarms or the missed detections explicitly. A comprehensive
centralized bias estimator is under development. The focus of this paper is the decentralized one.

In this paper, a new mathematical model for bearing–only bias estimation in distributed tracking systems was proposed.
This model was based on triangulation using the associated measurement reports or local bearing–only tracks from different

sensor pairs. It was shown that the proposed bias model has the advantage of being practical in scenarios with multiple
sensors. In particular, the proposed algorithm is effective when the sensor noise level and bias values are high. In addition,
previously proposed algorithms were dependent on target–sensor maneuvers and/or limited to certain noise levels. The new bias
model can handle any type of target–sensor motion and it is effective against 5◦ of offset bias in each sensor and uncertainty
levels up to 1.5◦ of noise standard deviation, which is higher than what was assumed in the literature previously. Also, the
proposed method can handle false alarms and missed detections in a centralized architecture. That is, the proposed algorithm
is practical in scenarios with realistic sensor parameter values. Finally, a batch ML estimator was proposed to solve the bias
estimation problem along with simulation results. A comprehensive centralized bias estimation algorithm with data association
for bearing–only sensors is in progress.
