ABSTRACT
Computational social scientists often harness the Web as a “societal
observatory” where data about human social behavior is collected.
This data enables novel investigations of psychological, anthropo-
logical and sociological research questions. However, in the ab-
sence of demographic information, such as gender, many relevant
research questions cannot be addressed. To tackle this problem,
researchers often rely on automated methods to infer gender from
name information provided on the web. However, little is known
about the accuracy of existing gender-detection methods and how
biased they are against certain sub-populations. In this paper, we
address this question by systematically comparing several gender
detection methods on a random sample of scientists for whom we
know their full name, their gender and the country of their work-
place. We further suggest a novel method that employs web-based
image retrieval and gender recognition in facial images in order
to augment name-based approaches. Our ﬁndings show that the
performance of name-based gender detection approaches can be bi-
ased towards countries of origin and such biases can be reduced by
combining name-based an image-based gender detection methods.

1.

INTRODUCTION

The Web enables studies of human social behavior on a very
large scale. For many research questions, demographic informa-
tion about individuals (such as age, gender or ethnic background)
is highly beneﬁcial but often particularly difﬁcult to obtain.

This has led previous research to employ different methods for
inferring the gender of individuals from names. For example, in
[2] the authors determine the gender of individuals using the name
repository from the US Social Security Administration and study
the relationship between gender and job performance among bro-
kerage ﬁrm. Mislove et al. [4] used the same name repository to
infer the gender of Twitter users by mapping their self-reported
names to the name database. In another study the authors aim to
study gender disparities in science and infer the gender of scientists
based on a similar approach [6]. Unfortunately, most previous work
does not provide information on how accurate different gender de-
tection methods are and/or how biased they are against certain sub-

populations. Although crowd sourcing methods can be seen as an
alternative for automated gender detection methods, they do not
scale well and are expensive. In the absence of a full name, more
sophisticated methods such as supervised machine learning mod-
els are used to harness the users content for detecting the gender
(see e.g. [5]). Yet, separate models are needed for gender detection
methods in each language community [1].

In this paper we evaluate and compare frequently used name-
based gender detection methods. We report overall accuracy and
also bias, i.e., deviating accuracy for different demographic sub-
populations (e.g. men, women and people living in different coun-
tries). Moreover, we propose novel methods that increase the accu-
racy of gender detection across heterogeneous sub-populations by
augmenting traditional methods with face recognition techniques.

2. DATA AND METHOD

For our evaluation, we utilized ground truth data from a previ-
ous study on global gender disparities in science [3]. It consists of
a manually labeled random sample of academics, their full names,
institutions, countries, and their gender. The ground truth was cre-
ated by inspecting CVs, pictures and institutional websites. After
removing ambiguous and repetitive names, the ﬁnal name list con-
sist of 693 male names and 723 female names.

We then evaluate different name-based gender detection methods
using the full names of our manually labeled scientists as input. Fi-
nally, we propose a new mixed method that combines name-based
and image-based gender detection.
2.1 Gender detection methods

In the following, we review some prominent unsupervised ap-
proaches that only require a name or picture as an input. These
approaches do not require training and are widely used in scientiﬁc
research as mentioned in the introduction.

Security Administration’s baby names data. The US Social Se-
curity Administration (SSA) covers registered baby names in the
United States since 1880. Many gender detection tools such as the
“gender” package in R1 or the OpenGenderTracking2 rely on this
database.
IPUMS Census data. Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS)
census data consists of samples of the American population drawn
from ﬁfteen federal censuses from the American Community Sur-
veys between 1850 to 2000. This database is also used in the “gen-
der” package in R and other web-based name extraction packages3.

Sexmachine. The list of 40,000 names is primarily collected by
Jörg Michael. Because of its availability, several libraries in various
languages (see for example C’s (gender.c) or Python’s Sexmachine
library4) use this database. Given a name, Sexmachine makes a
guess whether the name is male, mostly male, female, mostly fe-
male or unclear. The advantage of this name list is that it provides
detailed information about how popular a ﬁrst name is in a country
and how strongly it is associated with a given gender. Therefore, it
enables the disambiguation of names based on the country of ori-
gin. The list also provides information for a variety of countries
including China and India.
Genderize. Apart from publicly available name data bases there
are numerous commercial applications that incorporate various databases
from online resources to assess gender. The problem with com-
mercial applications is the difﬁculty to determine how the data is
gathered and processed. Among commercial detection methods
are Facebook graph API, Gender API, Namsor which is based on
Gender API and Genderize. In this work, we analyzed the latter
method. Genderize utilizes big datasets of information, from user
proﬁles across major social networks and exposes this data through
its API. The response includes a conﬁdence value5.
Face++. In addition to name-based gender detection methods, face
recognition algorithms have become a popular tool for inferring
the gender, e.g., for social media users. Among those, image-based
application Face++ seems to provide high performance [7]. This
approach requires access to a picture of the person.

In order to derive the gender for a speciﬁc scientist, we propose
to initially collect the ﬁrst ﬁve Google thumbnails using the full
name as search query term and then apply image-recognition on
the search results. This approach does not necessarily require that
the collected pictures depict the scientist we originally searched for,
but the idea is that we collect a sample of pictures that depict peo-
ple who are named like the person we searched for. The advantage
of using the full name as input is that for ﬁrst names that are am-
biguous or unisex, the combination of ﬁrst and last name is often a
better indicator of the gender associated with the certain culture.
A Novel Mixed Approach. In addition, we propose mixed meth-
ods that combine name-based detection methods with an image-
based face recognition approach. We test two variations of this
method. In method Mixed1, the best name-based approach, namely
Genderize, is used ﬁrst. For the remaining unidentiﬁed names, the
image-based method Face++, is used.
In method Mixed2, Gen-
derize and Face++ have equal weight. For the weighting, we do
not use a binary decision for each method, but also take the re-
ported conﬁdence as a numeric value into account. In doing so, this
method can handle ambiguous names more efﬁciently. Note that
method Mixed1 does not require retrieving pictures for the whole
population and is therefore more efﬁcient than method Mixed2.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The results displayed in Table 1 show that among individual
methods, image-based Face++ and Genderize perform relatively
better than others. However, the overall best results are achieved
by the mixed approaches, which outperform all others by at least
8% accuracy. Although all evaluated methods achieve high over-
all precision, recall rates vary. All gender detection methods show
comparable results for both classes (male and female) and therefore
no systematic gender-bias can be asserted.

By contrast, Table 2 indicates that the error rates strongly depend
on the country of residence of an individual. While name-based
approaches work quite well for western industrialized countries,
their performance deteriorates for emerging nations such as China,
South Korea or Brazil. Clearly, popular names of these countries
are not covered sufﬁciently in the databases at this point in time.
For these countries, an image-based approach leads to substantially
better results (e.g., for South Korea the accuracy of image-based ap-
proaches is at least 16% better than the best name-based method).
The Genderize method that also harnesses social media performs
poorly for China, presumably due to accessibility to the Chinese
social networking websites. Our proposed mixed approaches out-
perform the existing methods for the majority of the countries.

Conclusions: Our results suggest that the performance of name-
based gender detection approaches varies according to the coun-
try of origin and that performance for emerging nations is particu-
larly weak. Signiﬁcant enhancements can be achieved by combin-
ing name-based with image-based gender detection methods.
In
the future, our ﬁndings could be combined with machine learning
approaches to develop better methods for assessing demographic
attributes of users on the Web.
